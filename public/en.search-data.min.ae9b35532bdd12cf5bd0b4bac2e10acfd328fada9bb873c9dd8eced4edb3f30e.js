Why do we bother doing so many though? It’s because these events have a huge impact on ordinary businesses and are the wellsprings for new ideas and collaborations. Every event organized by Impact HUB Tokyo has a clear purpose and goal. We’ll introduce some of them below.\nFostering a culture of learning through failure with Fuckup Nights” Image courtesy of Impact HUB Tokyo\nIt is often said, “We learn more from failure, not from success.” Yet, society continues to sell the idea that there is a secret method to success. We rarely get the chance to ask predecessors about their failures or learn from them. Talks are often filled with success stories.\nAt Impact HUB Tokyo, we want to create an community culture where members can learn from each other’s failures. We introduced “Fuckup Nights”, which originated in Mexico and has spread to Impact HUB’s all over the world. In Japan, people rarely speak about their experiences, making sharing “failure stories” an even higher hurdle to jump over. For that reason, we localized an English event which encouraged direct communication, “Failure Sucks, but Instructs”, and ran our first event.\nOur first Fuckup Night had people sharing stories of failure that turned them red from head to toe, but was a great success. Despite the topic of the night being all about failure, the atmosphere was filled with optimism and warmth. This is one of the Impact HUB Tokyo’s most popular events that is held regularly in both English and Japanese.\nThe Fuckup Nights (https://www.facebook.com/jointhefunintokyo/) transformed our community. Increasingly, there were casual moments where members would share little failures, discuss them, and learn from them. One time, a member came in after making a proposal to a client and started a conversation with “I screwed up” while sipping his cup of coffee. That opened the floor to a hold a small revision meeting. Even as we were learning from our peers’ failures, we were able to help these demoralized members by renewing their energy to tackle their next challenge. As a result, our community adopted a positive culture where “failure does not invite more failure, but is a stepping stone.”\n“Spark Plug”: a pitch event where one can question the impact and ask, WHY? Image courtesy of Impact HUB Tokyo\n“Spark Plug” has been a popular event ever since Impact HUB Tokyo opened. This pitch event with a special focus on asking the key question “why” and with a focus on overall impact of initiatives was spearheaded by our co-founder, Potier, who has been to pitch events all over the world. Based on the belief that “people are not just service providers; they are connected by empathy”, the entrepreneurs who take the stage at the events passionately share, “Why did I become involved in this?” and “What do I hope to show with my results”?\nSpark Plug (https://hubsparkplug.doorkeeper.jp/) is part of Impact HUB Tokyo’s identity. This is where we challenge the current status quo and start ventures that will create an impact–where an exciting level of tension and peer pressure can be brought constructively into the community.\nCreating controlled chaos. Image courtesy of Impact HUB TokyoImage courtesy of Impact HUB Tokyo\nAt Impact HUB Tokyo, we also hold fun non-business-related events. One of them was a “Gyoza Making” event for our anniversary. This event, which held the theme “Make our own, Do it Together”, was very hands-on and required participants to make the gyoza skin and fillings all by themselves. Over 50 Hubbers and their family members gathered for that one day where we all focused on making gyoza with determination. Together, we did something we’d never tried before, prepped the ingredients, wrapped the gyoza, and created a gyoza production line. Every now and then, we would work together with someone new. We spoke with members we hadn’t seen in a long time while covered in flour, we ate gyoza with our families, and the day flew by.\nOur event organizer and Impact HUB Tokyo co-founder, Shino, reminds us, “Even in a space like this, it is important to continue nurturing a vibrant community”. There are times when a community can move unrelentingly towards a vision, which can cause friction and tension. In those moments, it is essential to inject a controlled chaos in to the community to shake things up. The gyoza making has its inherent meaning, the Impact HUB Tokyo adapted it to the organization’s style.\nInto the future of coworking spaces–Community is a new Laboratory. Image courtesy of Impact HUB Tokyo\nImpact HUB Tokyo has since evolved from its original model as a coworking space. What we are focusing on now is continuing our own personal development. We observe the community, observe changes, and take in news before introducing experimental initiatives.\nRecently within the kitchen space we’ve introduced a new accelerator program, “Kitchen Lab Course”, aimed at entrepreneurs who are thinking of launching food related businesses (such as lunch, dinner, catering or bento deliveries). In addition, we have a scholarship program, “Entrepreneur In Residence”, for seasoned entrepreneurs who have experience setting up a number of businesses, and “Startup In Residence” for startups which are in the process of establishing their business model. Impact HUB Tokyo’s founder has also continued challenging new ventures that will allow us to learn through the management of this space, develop new concepts, and implement new visions.\nHere at Impact HUB Tokyo we believe that “community” is a new laboratory. The various challenges and experiments, and the discoveries and changes we make will not develop from an environment that has its heart locked up. We also cannot say that it is sustainable to depend on a single superstar “entrepreneur” for innovation. Here at Impact HUB Tokyo, we will continue to look out for future signs and evolve with the community.\n This piece is a translation from Impact HUB Tokyo’s original post “Vol. 3 Impact HUB Tokyoの日常” with permission.\nWriter/Editor: Ishikawa Koumei (石川孔明) Translator: Levana Lam\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/docs/tokyo/space/','title':"Space as the community’s experiment lab",'section':"Tokyo",'content':"Impact HUB Tokyo: Space as the community’s experiment lab Archive date: June 12, 2018\nAn open, flexible, and multi-functional space “People First, Space Later” has been part of the Impact HUB Tokyo’s guiding philosophy since its inception. Though space comes after, it is nonetheless essential. For this post, we’ll explore how the Impact HUB Tokyo approaches the concept of “Space” below.\nIf you work your way down the slope from Meguro Station, you’ll find an old printing factory hidden in the residential alleys. Without changing the outer walls, Impact HUB Tokyo emerged from the interior renovations, as if it were a secret base or laboratory.\nSource: Impact Hub Tokyo Like many other Impact Hubs across the globe, Impact HUB Tokyo is located at the intersection of residential and business areas based on the belief that vibrant communities emerge through exchanges between local residents and businesses. In addition, to embody the spirit of an organization that adapts to the changing needs of its community, the Impact HUB Tokyo team decided to renovate the paper factory based on their needs rather than doing straight forward building restoration. With unusual requirements for an office space, the founders chose a printing factory a little ways from Meguro Station that met these requirements. The founders decided on the spot to make it the home of their new community and set to work cleaning and painting the factory with the new Impact HUB Tokyo team.\nImpact HUB Tokyo has a total of 440 square meters (4736 sq ft). When you open a door, you will be welcomed by the scent of drip coffee in an open area with a spacious kitchen, hotdesks, and lounge area.\nSource: Impact Hub Tokyo On one of the walls, you’ll find photos of members and the latest event information, and to the left of the kitchen there is an event space that can accommodate up to 200 people. Source: Impact Hub Tokyo Beyond the kitchen area is a workspace. Inside, there are various meeting rooms, spacious open office desks, and private offices.\nSource: Impact Hub Tokyo All of this is on the same floor, so it’s easy for members to see what’s going on and discover things that pop up. At the same time, the public and private spaces are separated so that members can also have a quiet space to concentrate on their work.\nDIY persistence and approaches to change Source: Impact Hub Tokyo Source: Impact Hub Tokyo At Impact HUB Tokyo, most of the furniture is made in Japan, second hand, or refurbished. Rather than buy expensive furniture and say, “We’re done!” with the setup, the Impact HUB Tokyo team was committed to sourcing ethical furniture and giving pieces a second life.\nThis approach meant that they continued to experiment with DIY furniture that could be easy to use, durable, but also flexible and multifunctional for community use. DIY hacking is a common scene at the space. Since the Impact HUB Tokyo also has a covered parking lot, it has become a DIY hacking space. For example, many ping pong tables were taken apart and made into white boards, which are now essential for daily discussions in meeting rooms.\nSource: Impact Hub Tokyo They were also devoted to making their own desks and chairs. In collaboration with a design company, members volunteered to help make desks that were uniquely shaped so that they could be moved and arranged together. The desks were like an ameba. Rather than being a square shape, each side is angled in the hexagon shape, so that there isn’t one “front” side that members need to sit at. Members don’t need to worry about sensitive work material being seen by someone right behind, while on the other hand they can also conveniently start a discussion.\nThe lighting has also been considered. Members can adjust lights to different shades and brightness for their area. With the various types of spaces, members can be comfortable and concentrate on their work in their favorite corner.\nHow space design nurtures impact creation Source: Impact Hub Tokyo Even though Impact HUB Tokyo has private workspace, once members join, they eventually move out to the co-working area. So far, our observation is that teams who have moved out to the co-working area have been more successful than teams who have stayed in the private workspace.\nOne reason could be that interactions with different people leads to new ideas and collaborations, but even more importantly, members can boost morale in their exchanges with others.\nSource: Impact Hub Tokyo\nOur founders joke that the kitchen area is a hub in the Hub. Members are always gathered around the coffee maker, having random chats with a coffee mug in hand. Just a casual “Coffee’s ready. How about a coffee together?” quickly becomes an intense discussion. Other people who pass by quickly join in and very soon, there’s a full-on meeting in the lounge. That’s a common occurrence. The collaboration at Impact HUB Tokyo happens not in a meeting room, but the open spaces.\nThe Impact HUB Tokyo’s location and coworking space design was a departure from the typical office spaces available at the time. This design served the Impact HUB’s main thesis that effective impact happens through collaboration.\nRevolutions begin in coffeehouses** Hogarth William (1884) The reason Impact HUB Tokyo is committed to creating the right space is because it’s not meant to be just a coworking space for work, but rather a place where positive impact initiatives are born and nurtured.\nIn his TEDTalk “Where good ideas come from“, American writer Steven Johnson said, “People think that important breakthrough ideas happen by deliberating deeply alone (‘People often credit their ideas to individual “Eureka!” moments’), but actually new ideas happen in places where people from different backgrounds get together to discuss ideas.”\nHe says that the industrial revolution in England did not succeed without a coffeehouse. “It was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds, different fields of expertise, and share. This is the kind of chaotic environment where ideas were likely to come together, where people were likely to have new, interesting, unpredictable collisions — people from different backgrounds.” He describes this network that produces innovation as a “liquid network”.\nIf there is a space where diverse people exchange ideas, could there be a continuous flow of new collaborations? From observing how people gather as a community, not everyone joins the same discussion. First, ideas usually take seed from deep discussions we have with a small group of people we’re close to. These ideas get refined as they are taken from place to place and further discussed with new people. It is from collecting these scattered responses that an idea actually emerges into a plan. In order for these many ideas to be actioned by a community, there has to be a “node” to channel people’s passion and create momentum.\nThe Impact HUB Tokyo takes inspiration from observing its community and experiments with tangible and intangible inputs so that the space can help maximize the outcome of each members’ projects. By doing this day after day, we accumulate “know-how” and can continue to accelerate our speed of innovation by learning from community experience.\n This piece is a translation from Impact HUB Tokyo’s original post “Impact HUB Hosts’ Story Vol.1 : 空間は、コミュニティの実験のためのラボ” with permission.\nWriter/Editor: Ishikawa Koumei (石川孔明) Translator: Yuki Fujimoto\n"});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/docs/tokyo/hosting-team/','title':"The hosting team and members",'section':"Tokyo",'content':"The hosting team and members BY : ATHENA June 19, 2018\nA facilitator of a community “Hosting team” Source: Impact Hub Tokyo Impact HUB Tokyo is a co-working place where Impact Makers get together. Various initiatives are created in order to facilitate collaboration between members. In Part 1, we covered how the design of the space, facilities, and furniture can support innovation. However, no matter how amazing the space is or how many strangers are gathered together…that alone isn’t enough for innovation. In order to new approaches, the “software” needs to be added to the existing “hardware”. In other words, there has to be a system that helps foster relationships between members to become a networked community. For this post, we will introduce the Impact HUB Tokyo’s “hosting team” that curates, supports, and nurtures this community ecosystem.\nThe Impact HUB Tokyo’s hosting team acts as a community facilitator. This role has multiple facets, but it could be divided roughly into two types. The first one is the role as the administrator to ensure that members using the co-working space can work comfortably. A host is crucial to help minimize distractions for members who want to focus. For example, the responsibilities can range from booking meeting rooms, to explaining how to use facilities and trouble shooting equipment for members. A host is there to help address issues so that members don’t have to break the flow of their work.\nCommunity is bound by “why” not “what” Source: Impact Hub Tokyo Another key role for the hosting team is facilitation to proactively nurture an active community. Communities can exist without a host, but a host can help identify appropriate initiatives, foster positive energy, and inspire the community with new ideas. One of the hosts who specializes in cross-cultural communication, Misaki Iwai, describes the role as follows:\n“A host is like catalyst for the Impact HUB Tokyo community. We support new members so that they can be get used to the environment easily. Our role is to bring the right mix of people together, the way chemists invent new compounds. Through our daily interactions with members, we know their priorities and challenges and connect them to the relevant Hub members at the right time. If members have the same challenge, we may create events or offer a team learning session.”\nWhile doing these things, they have also observed how the community responds and realised that there is one more essential condition to produce innovation. The members in the community are bound together not by the what, but by the why.\n“When people first get to know each other, what do they do? What position do they hold at work? What is their appearance like? In other words, we tend to focus on the “what”. Of course, collaboration can happen based on the “what”, but in order to go deeper, and have collaboration become innovation — for this challenge, my opinion is — And I really like this — people need to be brought together with a shared *why *[purpose].”\nCollaboration can happen even at the what level. For example, if a company wanted to improve their design, they would ask a designer, “What am I missing, or what can I do?” in case of a company who wants to enhance their design, if they agree with the approaches proposed, then they can collaborate to improve the product. Once you’ve started collaborating, in order to create deeper and large-scale changes over time, there needs to be a process of continuous innovation.\nOn the other hand, the discontinuous quantum leap process* is complex and cannot be approached in a straight forward manner. Members who still have many uncertainties, but have issues they cannot stop thinking about may talk to other members about their ideas bit by bit to refine their ideas. The people who end up working together are connected not for utilitarian purposes, but rather by a shared sense of passion, and are able to collaborate and produce results that they couldn’t have imagined alone.\nThe hosting team understand the importance of process for innovation and takes time every day to have casual conversations with members to get a sense of their personal “why”. When they see commonalities, they connect people who seem unrelated on paper. Misaki describes the process as an iceberg.’What we can see is just the top of iceberg, and we can’t see bigger parts under water. A host’s most critical skill is the ability to see under water and connect the members at the right time.’ The hosting team at Impact HUB Tokyo is supporting community beneath the surface.\n This piece is a translation from Impact HUB Tokyo’s original post “Impact HUB Hosts’ STORY Vol.2 HUBのメンバーシップとホスティングチーム（前編)” with permission.\nWriter/Editor: Ishikawa Koumei (石川孔明) Translator: Yuki Fujimoto\n"});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/docs/tokyo/entrepreneurship-thoughts/','title':"Thoughts on entrepreneurship and climbing",'section':"Tokyo",'content':"Thoughts on entrepreneurship and climbing Archive date: May 10, 2018\nEditorial Note: The original Japanese word “登山” is a general term that means going up a mountain and can refer to hiking, trekking, climbing, and mountaineering. In this piece, the author is usually referring to hiking, but the translation team has made some editorial decisions based on cultural context.\nMany moments, I find myself reflecting on the similarities between climbing and entrepreneurship. It began with my love of nature which got me into climbing and trail running. For example, Impact HUB Tokyo is like a mountain hut, where climbers can rest, take shelter, and get the latest information. Let’s start with some other common parallels to reflect on the startup life through the experience of climbing.\nOthers say it’s crazy. But is it really? Image courtesy of Impact HUB Tokyo The words “climbing” and “entrepreneurship” seem to elicit the same reactions in people. Of course, I’m referring mostly about people who aren’t interested in climbing or entrepreneurship. Both topics usually elicit words like “hard” or “challenging”. From an ordinary person’s perspective, the mountain is a place that brings about exhaustion, the heat, then the cold, too many bugs, and even the bears. But for people who actually climb, the “difficult” parts don’t make up that much of the experience. Proper preparations can also be made to deal with dangerous situations.\nIt can perhaps be said that people climb for the experience and sense of achievement that comes from overcoming hardships. For mountain lovers, the lack of electricity, the burden of carrying water and other essentials — the sum of all the modern-day inconveniences is precisely the charm.\nEven though people refer to “climbing” as if there was only one way up a mountain, there are actually many ways to do it. There are those who seek out the tallest and most difficult mountains, or those who pride themselves on hitting all of Japan’s 100 Famous Peaks, or those who enjoy a relaxing hike appreciating the alpine flora. Perhaps it is because climbing can have something for everyone that it has become so popular. Some people do not even care about making the summit. Trail runs are also faster compared to hiking, giving a different experience to the same mountain. The physical challenges are also quite different. Either way, it’s possible to meet great friends/comrades through the various ways one spends time on a mountain. This sense of camaraderie is probably also what supports lonely entrepreneurs and career-driven people in their 30s and 40s.\nThe simplicity and force of “Because I like it” Image courtesy of Impact HUB Tokyo Entrepreneurs like their jobs and climbers like their climbing. Despite something being “hard”, you do it because you like it. And because you like it, you can keep going; what’s more, you’ll push yourself to go even further.\nThe thing is, with hiking, your route is complete once you’ve gone up and down the mountain. But for entrepreneurship, it feels like there’s never an end in sight. In that respect, climbing guarantees a sense of fulfilment once you’ve finished your route. Also, you can plan for climbing. You can estimate the duration of a route, prepare for hazards or high altitudes, and turn back when the weather is bad or your body can’t go on. You can mitigate risks, plan to arrive at a rest hut before sunset, and make sure there is ample time planned in your schedule. Climbing has many different tried and true methods. Because on the mountain, what you do is, in essence, a matter of life and death.\nIt could be said that deep down, both entrepreneurship and trekking is like putting your life at stake. Except entrepreneurship isn’t about survival so much as it is about the scale of effect this choice has on your way of life.\nTo lose not to adversity and keep going onward. There is a famous commencement speech that the late Steve Jobs gave. In his first story, he talked about connecting the dots. These “dots” can be all the moments in all the days that eventually lead you towards a summit. But for Jobs, “you can’t connect the dots looking forward… you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future” by finding and doing what you love. In Jobs’ words, “The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle.” If those of us who seek, be it entrepreneurs or climbers, don’t stop searching until we have found our calling. If we can abandon “common sense” and find what we love, then maybe we can approach that state of “staying hungry and foolish” that Jobs speaks of.\nThis time, I drew parallels between climbing and entrepreneurship based on my own experiences on mountain trails, but there will certainly be those who say, “That’s not true” or “It’s not like that”. If I have the opportunity, next time I would like to hear the unique experiences and perspectives from my fellow Hubbers.\n Story by Ryoko Okamoto Up until the point of writing, I have climbed Mount Fuji, Mount Kita, Mount Kitahotaka, Mount Tsubakuro, Mount Jonen to Mount Aino, Mount Haku, and Mount Takao. My first trail running competition was the Three Peaks Race, a 23km short course. In 2016, I completed the 100km Mount Haku geo-trail in 3 days. I’m considering entering the 7-day 250km challenge next year.\nIn general, I like travelling and “playing”. If nature and yummy food are added too, my life is complete! I am currently seeking out a style of work that has flexible hours and is location-independent through trial and error. I’m also learning from the entrepreneurial spirit at Impact HUB Tokyo.\n This piece is a translation from Impact HUB Tokyo’s original post “Vol. 2 登山と起業は似てる Members’ Story” with permission.\nWriter/Editor: Ryoko Okamoto (岡村亮子) Translator: Michelle Lai\n"});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/docs/tokyo/','title':"Tokyo",'section':"Docs",'content':"Translation for Impact Hub Tokyo About the Project We covered Japanese startups, social enterprises, NGOs, entrepreneurs, solopreneuers, and self-sustaining programs that serve customers and create value for Japan.

Archive: March 26, 2018\nQuestioning + Action = Impact Image courtesy of Impact HUB Tokyo\nIn February 2013, Impact HUB Tokyo had begun renovations a former print factory’s ground floor. After surviving for two years, co-founders Shino and Shingo, painted the words “Questioning + Action = Impact” on the building’s white wall. The words embody the ethos of the company: it is only though questioning the status quo that we can begin to take action. From this, the actions create the programs and organisations that make a positive impact on society. They were convinced that this equation reflected the shared values of the people from all walks of life who gathered at Impact HUB Tokyo.\nSince then, Impact HUB Tokyo has grown into a thriving community of 400 entrepreneurs (since June, 2017). When one hears the word “entrepreneur”, the image of a company or NGO founder probably comes to mind. But originally, the word entrepreneur referred to a person who questions the current situation and takes action”. The Impact HUB Tokyo has fostered the community of people they called Impact Makers.\nImpact Makers are not restricted to an industry or position. They are not only founders, but also freelancers, artists, or business people working for corporations or government officers. Anyone can be an Impact Maker. Their common point is their approach as people who are critical of how things are right now and taking action to contribute to a better future.\nImpact that can change the course of a river Image courtesy of Impact HUB Tokyo\nWhy is the Impact HUB Tokyo focused on impact? The seeds of this mission were sown before the two founders founded the organization, which itself is a social enterprise. One of the founders, Shino previously worked for international NGOs and a think tank, and also did social and environmentally responsible investments (impact investment) in developing countries and EU, and business development and R\u0026amp;D projects in foreign countries. She first learned about the Impact HUB during her time in the UK. The first Impact HUB opened its doors in Islington, in the North of London and has since spread globally, attracting entrepreneurs working to create positive impacts in their respective regions and communities.\nShino visited various Impact HUBs and noted their distinct characters. For example, the first Impact HUB in Islington had many social entrepreneurs and environmental activists. At the Impact HUB SF, there were venture capitalists who made investments in startups successively. Shino spent much of her time at Impact HUB Westminster in Central London. There, she found not only entrepreneurs, but also hackers, engineers, designers, who worked on new collaborations every day.\nImage courtesy of Impact HUB Tokyo\nShino was thinking it was not only the people engaged in poverty and education that could throw controversy to society. Entrepreneurs pioneering robotics and artists revealing the world’s hypocracies can also change society. Shino felt that Japan also needed an open place to house an entrepreneurial community and attract like-minded people to build connections. So, when she returned to Tokyo, she founded the Impact HUB Tokyo.\nImpact HUB Tokyo does not believe that impact is created by the lone hero. If one were to imagine how a river flows, the course of a river is changed by the complex interactions it has with the natural environment. Societal norms can also shift as the result of an accumulation of bold actions. As individuals who make up society, it is within our power to to create a big wave (critical mass) of questioning that triggers a change in direction. We can persist in working on disruptive impact until the course of the river changes. This scene plays out every day at the Impact HUB Tokyo makes, and is the enabling environment Shino had envisioned.\nImage courtesy of Impact HUB Tokyo\nWorld-Class entrepreneurship, Japanese style Image courtesy of Impact HUB Tokyo\nThe Impact HUB Tokyo’s other founder, Shingo Potier, brings another set of experiences. Shingo previously worked at a financial institution in London and worked with local start-ups. Shingo had the opportunity to support a Japanese startup and discovered the lack of support for entrepreneurs in the country. He found that while there were passionate entrepreneurs, there were few visionary “game changers” who could disrupt existing industries. He found Japanese entrepreneurs to prefer safe harmony that fitted into existing norms rather than innovation, too complacent for him.\nAccording to Shingo, “This is not just an issue of entrepreneurial quality”. He has seen the scenario again and again, where the visions and passions of entrepreneurs are twisted and taken apart by intermediaries who were risk-adverse and preferred short-term returns. The VCs and financial institutions that were meant to support entrepreneurs were the ones that created the barriers and undynamic environment. In contrast to the UK government actively fostering entrepreneurial education, the Japanese government did not understand the needs of entrepreneurs or how to develop competitive global businesses.\nUnsurprisingly, when compared to the UK, the support for entrepreneurship in Japan was not good. Though Shingo was disheartened, he reset his approach to “Forget what doesn’t exist, and focus on what does.” He felt there had to be a Japanese-style of entrepreneurship that could be world-class. In order to create that, there needed to be a new approach to educating entrepreneurs on how to make an impact on the existing system.\nAround that time, he met Impact HUB Tokyo. He joined as a financial specialist, helped structure management and he started two programs: “Team 360” to share his startup knowledge with new entrepreneurs and the pitch event “Spark Plug”.\nBe the change Image courtesy of Impact HUB Tokyo\nBoth founders agree that for an Impact Maker a change is neither a trend to follow, nor even an attempt to change another person.” Rather, in the words of Gandhi,“Be the change that you wish to see in the world.” The only thing we can reliably do is change ourselves and embody the change that we wish to see in the world.\nJust like the Impact Makers who come every day, the Impact HUB Tokyo is constantly growing. The activities, ways of connecting, and space layout are constantly evolving. The only thing that remains unchanged for the Impact HUB Tokyo community is the constant process of change itself.\nLearn more about Impact HUB Tokyo’s culture in Impact HUB Tokyo: What’s a Basecamp.\n This piece is a translation from Impact HUB Tokyo’s original post “Founders’ Story Vol. 1 Impact MAKERとは？” with permission.\nWriter/Editor: Ishikawa Koumei (石川孔明) Translator: Yuki Fujimoto\n"});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/docs/tokyo/basecamp/','title':"What’s a basecamp?",'section':"Tokyo",'content':"What\u0026rsquo;s a basecamp? Archive date: April 2, 2018\nThe Basecamp for Extreme Climbers Image courtesy of Impact HUB Tokyo\nWhat differentiates the Impact HUB Tokyo other investor and VC-backed co-working spaces and incubators? The founders, Shino and Shingo, describe their role as a basecamp for alpine climbers. The Impact Makers who question the status quo and take action to create the change they want to see in the world are like the climbers who scale the summits to see the glorious panoramas below. Like these alpine basecamps, Impact Makers also need their basecamp to summit a mountain no-one else has yet charted.\nWhat basecamp essentials are needed to serve an Impact Maker? The most important component is whatever helps them maximize their effectiveness (output). To facilitate this, workspaces are designed to attract and foster quality. Such a space is designed to support entrepreneurial productivity, but also help these changemakers relax. For that reason, a lounge, kitchen space, cafe, and other facilities play an important role to restore their energy for the long-haul.\nTangible and intangible inputs for high-quality output Image courtesy of Impact HUB Tokyo\nMaintaining high quality performance can only happen with equally high quality inputs. Even the most resolved Impact Maker will encounter huge setbacks with a half-baked roadmap or inadequate equipment and know-how. For this reason, the Impact HUB Tokyo’s founders initially focused on support programs for startups. Even after running for several years, the Impact HUB Tokyo continues to research startup trends in Japan and globally to update and introduce new accelerator programs in Tokyo and in Japan.\nAlso, quality learning is made possible through frequent community experience and knowledge sharing. That point is a crucial part of Impact HUB Tokyo’s ethos. Support for startups does not end at investment and business plan advisory. For example, entrepreneurs also need help on practical issues like issuing credit cards after business setup, or back office needs like accounting, secretarial work and drafting contracts.\nIn practice, the Impact HUB Tokyo facilitates sharing for general and specific experiences, ideas as well as professional tips on a daily basis. Sometimes, it’s a casual chat in the lounge space, but the organisation also hosts a variety of events. The events are not only the official events hosted by Impact HUB Tokyo staff, but also casual events that members initiate. This atmosphere demonstrates the Impact HUB Tokyo’s grassroots, organic community growth.\nThe Common core in Impact HUB Tokyo’s programs Image Courtesy of Impact HUB Toky\nThat sums up the various aspects of the organic design behind our programs that make this space a basecamp for Impact Makers. Next, we will introduce the Impact HUB Tokyo’s highlight programs.\nImpact HUB Tokyo offers eight programs in two categories (as of June, 2017). The two categories are “Laboratory Programmes”, which are available only to members and intensive “Accelerator Programmes” that are open to the public. Below, we share the key concepts that underly all the programs.\nTeam learning The programs that Impact HUB Tokyo develop challenge traditional processes and the status quo. Many existing startup programs use the traditional schooling methods where concepts like marketing and business plans are taught by a “teacher”. In truth, for a generation of entrepreneurs trying to create change by using the latest technologies and approaches like crowdfunding do not find these traditional methods that relevant. In addition, there are programs where famous startup founders give advice to new entrepreneurs. However, these talks only temporarily inspire people and don’t have a long-lasting effect and some advice can even confuse entrepreneurs who are just starting out.\nInstead, Impact HUB Tokyo’s founders focused on “continuous team learning”. Rather than relying on the snippets of advice successful startup founders impart from the stage, the Impact HUB Tokyo is convinced that a steady process of growing in the trenches together will have a more effective impact for entrepreneurs in Japan. Therefore, the focus lies in fostering relationships between members, not through competion, but rather encouraging mutual support. The relationships that are created in the community will carry members forward even after they have moved on.\nCreating businesses that deliver a core value Entrepreneurs are often focus on “revenue” and “selling” when planning or just after startup. In addition, they often want to secure immediate returns or investment and forget about the core value proposition that their business should be delivering. Such businesses may be initially successful, but eventually, such founders will ask themselves, “Why am I doing this?” and “Why does this product or service even need to exist?”. Then, the business’ core falls apart. Unfortunately, the reality is that many startups fail. The Impact HUB Tokyo delivers programs so that entrepreneurs can find a strong mission and value proposition (core) so that entrepreneurs can build businesses that are aligned to their goals as they grow.\nFinally, the Impact HUB Tokyo pays a crucial role in supporting Impact Makers and entrepreneurs. Even the most strong-willed and determined Impact Maker must learn to embrace the fear that comes with founding a business. To overcome this and their subconscious self-limitations, these entrepreneurs need someone to be beside them. Their partner needs to also be an Impact Maker who understand how it feels, and the Impact HUB Tokyo as a startup itself meets this requirement.\nPersistence makes perfect After the programs began, the results from “learning as a team” have been remarkable. Some program graduates had “refills” (okawari) of this approach by forming their own groups. One year later, the growth has been overwhelming, with the startups experiencing a remarkable growth, demonstrating the effectiveness of the continued peer pressure from a team.\nFor this reason, Impact HUB Tokyo also places an emphasis on post-program support. Programs with a fixed duration usually only focus on the business plan, but unfinished work and next steps remain unsupported. The Impact HUB Tokyo offers successive follow-up with entrepreneurs, a system for tracking progress, and positive peer pressure. These follow-up components help more graduates succeed in the long-term, which also improves the program’s overall success rate.\nNot just a co-working space Courtesy of Impact HUB Tokyo\nAs a basecamp for the arduous climb that is entrepreneurship, the Impact HUB Tokyo helps these courageous climbers create innovative solutions by providing the tangible and intangible support to help them rest and recharge — though it’s a lot of work, this comprehensive design is a solid foundation. In order to amplify the impact of the people who gather here, the Impact HUB Tokyo creates both hard and soft supports in its community and space design.\nLearn more about the Impact Makers that make up Impact HUB Tokyo’s dynamic entrepreneurial community.\n This piece is a translation from Impact HUB Tokyo’s original post “Founders’ Story: Vol. 2 Basecampとは？” with permission.\nWriter/Editor: Ishikawa Koumei (石川孔明) Translator: Yuki Fujimoto\n"});})();
