# Translation for Impact Hub Tokyo

## About the Project

We covered Japanese startups, social enterprises, NGOs, entrepreneurs, solopreneuers, and self-sustaining programs that serve customers and create value for Japan. We cover founders’ stories and learnings to share knowledge and concrete takeaways for other entrepreneurs and innovators in East Asia. Our posts can cover a wide range of topics such as Japanese technology companies, consumer apps, aging populations, health tech, IoT, education and edtech, recycling and upcycling, employment for low-income households, social services for minorities. These services can provided in Japan and include expansions to markets in East Asia and Southeast Asia. Our case studies focus on product development, business development, growth hacking, team culture, leadership, work-life balance, triple bottom line businesses, startup fundraising, and startup exits.

## Editorial Team


The editors of Business 3.0 have tech startup, social enterprise, social innovation, and impact investing experiences.

We are in pursuit of people who prove us wrong. We say “wrong” because there is nothing wrong with being wrong — it is simply that our way of seeing the world has been challenged. We want to constantly recalibrate and expand our ways of seeing the world, of radically challenging ourselves to stay humble in the pursuit of being open-minded.
