Rather than pursue a venture-backed business model, Steven’s devotion to product development and revenue-driven growth also afforded him the time to pursue other meaningful experiences in life, such as travel and be a digital nomad. After his first few years as a solopreneur, Steven began to build a team to expand GoodNotes into a tool that can realise the potential of digital note taking for every work situation. Find out how and why GoodNotes has gained success by aiming for profitability over fundraising.\n When there’s no clear path, build something to find it.\n Steven staked his career on GoodNotes. He had one final semester to complete and no clear career in sight. Steven enrolled in the easiest electives to finish up his degree and doubled down on an app idea he had been mulling over for months. His idea for the GoodNotes app emerged out of his own need as a student to take notes that were easy to save and didn’t take up space. None of the apps available in 2010 quite fitted his needs, so he set about to create his own. Fortunately, GoodNotes was not Steven’s first attempt to build a product. He had begun teaching himself programming since he was 10, before the first iPhone came out. He built games with Macromedia Flash throughout secondary school and when the first iPad came out, he tried building a documentation app for developers. This first app had mild success, but it gave him deep insight into his own working style and the product development process. His years of first-hand experience in obsessing over product features, combined with his curiosity and self-taught understanding of startup methodology, prepared him for his new venture.\nDelivering unparalleled UX through understated details From day one, GoodNotes had a specific target user: math students like Steven. Unlike humanities majors, who could type lecture notes on laptops, writing was still the best way for notes with numbers and calculations. But having tried other handwriting apps available on the first iPad, Steven knew that subtle details were the crux of UX for note taking. When Steven did his market research with other note taking apps, he noted that they lacked the exact combination of features he wanted. In addition, the feeling of writing was just not as good and that created a barrier for him continuing to use them.\nHe set out to build the app he could happily use every day, but focused on developing features around his observations from other apps. As a solopreneur, Steven worked on his app’s features organically, but they centred around these two UX themes:\n Recreating the feeling of writing Improving the note taking experience  Recreating the feeling of writing While apps, as minimum viable products (MVPs), initially focus on function over form in order to validate features, in some cases, form is part of function. For GoodNotes, the aesthetic of recreating realistic ink was crucial for a convincing writing experience. Creating a convincing writing aesthetic helped users focus on their writing. Steven says, “User Experience is the most important. How can the ink bleed work better? How can the texture be more realistic, to the point where people forget it’s an iPad?”\nImproving the note taking experience However, just recreating the writing experience was not necessarily enough to keep users, or attract die-hard analogue writers. The second part of GoodNotes’ product development required unlocking the potential of a digital tablet as a multifunctional tool that surpasses paper. This meant that GoodNotes had to build out features that could address the other pain points of note taking on paper. For Steven, the app had to create an experience that “could anticipate what a user wants to do, so that they would never need to go back to pen and paper.” However, these features may not always be obvious. Instead, Steven observed, “Many small features created a compound effect for users.” Rather than relying on major features that could be quickly replicated by competitors, such as having different notebooks, GoodNotes also differentiated itself through a micro-level obsession to UX details, such as the app automatically switching back to writing mode following erasing notes. Some seemingly small conveniences, however, require incredible investment to do well, such as using machine learning combined with global search functions to be able to group relevant information to provide a more personalised assistance for app users rather than just returning exact word matches. Adding this feature and delivering the same quality of experience for multiple languages, such as Chinese, also requires significant behind-the-scenes investment. The result is a smooth and seamless experience for a broad base of global users in a multitude of scenarios, which builds the enduring popularity of the app.\nEvolving product development by growing the team As a frequent user for his own app, Steven prioritised features based on the number of requests he received from users and his own pain points. As a solo devleoper, who did everything from customer support to feature development, there was no specific process to feature prioritisation. Now that Steven has built a team, GoodNotes has a product development process and can do more in-depth UX planning, such as conducting user research. With the additional investment, the team can now understand key questions that guide future product development, such as:\n How and why are users actually using GoodNotes? How does GoodNotes fit into users lives and workflow?  Features are now developed according to product development best practices, such as wireframing, protyping, and user testing. However, one tip that Steven gives to solopreneurs is that you can still do key UX exercises with limited resources. He says that shortly after he brought on his early team members, they took advantage of WWDC to ask for volunteer user testers through a newsletter and Twitter call out to do tests in San Jose during the conference. Fans would not only drive for hours to give them valuable product feedback, but rooted for the lean startup team by evangelising for GoodNotes.\nEditor’s note: The photo shown above is courtesy of a GoodNotes user. You can check out more on GoodNotes’ Instagram.\nCharting a course for revenue-led growth As a solo founder and product owner, most of Steven’s time was devoted to product development, rather than “growth hacking”. Rather than use the startup approach of acquiring a large user base for an app to attract investors, Steven saw his app as his direct income generator. This means that Steven charged for his app since it launched. The income from the app justified his continued investment to iterating the product to improve the experience of his users, who became his evangelists. In contrast, venture-backed companies need to answer to investors, who may want to push certain features that are not in the users’ best interests. Steven estimates he dedicated a solid six hours of coding every day when he was first developing the app, not knowing where it would go and whether it would be well received. Steven laughs when he recalls, “One of the worst things is getting a user message saying that something didn’t work. They couldn’t open something.” Though he was often caught firefighting, this product-first approach, fuelled the app’s organic, often word-of-mouth, growth. Steven says he did not invest in marketing.\nPicking the right details to fuss over for launch For his app launch, Steven committed resources that seem, at first, counter to MVP approaches. Steven invested in details such as the logo design so that the product looked professional and personally wrote on-boarding messages. When the app launched, it had English and French version and was soon localised into Japanese as well. The handwritten messages, in this case, was aligned with the app’s core note taking offer. In addition, the early app functioned the same way for people taking notes in any language, so translating early on-boarding messages allowed it to expand quickly into new markets. The Japanese localisation got GoodNotes featured on Japan’s App Store within months of the app’s launch.\nSolopreneur as product owner  “Building GoodNotes has never not been a challenge. User feedback and encouragement was one of the main motivations for me when I was just starting out.” – Steven Chan\n As a solopreneur, Steven was never distracted from developing his product by fundraising. Instead, as the product owner, he responded to user requests and won over fans who would recommend the app by word of mouth, which is a more valuable form of marketing than paid advertising for customer acquisition. Steven’s focus on improving the product built a community that helped amplify the reach of his app.\nTaking GoodNotes to heights only teams can deliver When asked about his early milestone targets during our interview, Steven paused. He then responded, “In the first few years… I guess it was mostly about beating competitors. I didn’t have specific growth targets in mind.” Aside from the bottom line, that the app generated revenue that he was happy with and continued to incrementally grow, Steven was not fixed on chasing optimistic growth targets. However, once he decided to pursue a bigger product vision, he had to build a team, which also means expanding the GoodNotes business model. After working on GoodNotes for 4 years, Steven wanted to realise his more ambitious features for GoodNotes. To execute, he had to build a team, which was a new challenge he was eager to try. However, as a revenue-focused company that has not sought funding, Steven continued to build a product-focused team. This means that the GoodNotes team still consists of people who work on product: developers, UX/UI designers, and product leads. With a team to sustain, GoodNotes also needed to expand from a B2C (consumer) market into a B2B market with schools and offices. This was aligned with Steven’s vision of GoodNotes as a tool that augmented note taking, helping to facilitate key human interactions such as meetings, collaborations, learning, and communication. Steven mentions that the app is meant to reduce the manual work of typing up notes after meetings, and instead creating a digital set of notes that everyone can contribute to, work off of, and keep. Of course, business development also includes improving localisation and servicing strategic geographic markets. For example, GoodNotes has a team member in Germany, one of the app’s most popular markets, to grow its customer base. In addition, the company has invested in more engagement channels, such as Instagram, which is quickly catching up to their e-mail engagement. As a team, GoodNotes can now not only dedicate resources to taking care of users through feature development, but also customer service and community engagement.\nChoose profitability over fundraising At this point, it might seem as though the natural path is fundraising. For that, Steven has a clear response: “Fundraising is a full-time job, and right now, we don’t have the time for that.” Steven says that investors have approached the company, but he has not taken investment because it requires a different focus. Instead, the company continues to focus on profitability-driven growth. As we were wrapping up the interview, Steven shared his outlook on how the digital handwriting era would help people work and learn better, and the features GoodNotes was already working on to help make that happen.\nMessage to entrepreneurs We asked Steven what message he would share with developers and entrepreneurs just starting out. He said, “Study what you don’t already know.” Steven said that in high school, he read discussions on HackerNews since it was first launched and read entrepreneurship books. Even though he was interested in computer science, he decided to study mathematics to learn something new in university. For entrepreneurs looking for their first product to build, Steven gave this advice: “Work on something that that you really want to know about, something where you really care about the details.”\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/docs/tokyo/hub-tokyo/day-at-impact-hub-tokyo/','title':"A Day at Impact HUB Tokyo",'section':"Hub Tokyo",'content':"A Day at Impact HUB Tokyo Archive date: February 22, 2018\nImpact HUB Tokyo hosts a variety of events every week. Why do we bother doing so many though? It’s because these events have a huge impact on ordinary businesses and are the wellsprings for new ideas and collaborations. Every event organized by Impact HUB Tokyo has a clear purpose and goal. We’ll introduce some of them below.\nFostering a culture of learning through failure with Fuckup Nights” It is often said, “We learn more from failure, not from success.” Yet, society continues to sell the idea that there is a secret method to success. We rarely get the chance to ask predecessors about their failures or learn from them. Talks are often filled with success stories.\nAt Impact HUB Tokyo, we want to create an community culture where members can learn from each other’s failures. We introduced “Fuckup Nights”, which originated in Mexico and has spread to Impact HUB’s all over the world. In Japan, people rarely speak about their experiences, making sharing “failure stories” an even higher hurdle to jump over. For that reason, we localized an English event which encouraged direct communication, “Failure Sucks, but Instructs”, and ran our first event.\nOur first Fuckup Night had people sharing stories of failure that turned them red from head to toe, but was a great success. Despite the topic of the night being all about failure, the atmosphere was filled with optimism and warmth. This is one of the Impact HUB Tokyo’s most popular events that is held regularly in both English and Japanese.\nThe Fuckup Nights (https://www.facebook.com/jointhefunintokyo/) transformed our community. Increasingly, there were casual moments where members would share little failures, discuss them, and learn from them. One time, a member came in after making a proposal to a client and started a conversation with “I screwed up” while sipping his cup of coffee. That opened the floor to a hold a small revision meeting. Even as we were learning from our peers’ failures, we were able to help these demoralized members by renewing their energy to tackle their next challenge. As a result, our community adopted a positive culture where “failure does not invite more failure, but is a stepping stone.”\n“Spark Plug”: a pitch event where one can question the impact and ask, WHY? “Spark Plug” has been a popular event ever since Impact HUB Tokyo opened. This pitch event with a special focus on asking the key question “why” and with a focus on overall impact of initiatives was spearheaded by our co-founder, Potier, who has been to pitch events all over the world. Based on the belief that “people are not just service providers; they are connected by empathy”, the entrepreneurs who take the stage at the events passionately share, “Why did I become involved in this?” and “What do I hope to show with my results”?\nSpark Plug (https://hubsparkplug.doorkeeper.jp/) is part of Impact HUB Tokyo’s identity. This is where we challenge the current status quo and start ventures that will create an impact–where an exciting level of tension and peer pressure can be brought constructively into the community.\nCreating controlled chaos. At Impact HUB Tokyo, we also hold fun non-business-related events. One of them was a “Gyoza Making” event for our anniversary. This event, which held the theme “Make our own, Do it Together”, was very hands-on and required participants to make the gyoza skin and fillings all by themselves. Over 50 Hubbers and their family members gathered for that one day where we all focused on making gyoza with determination. Together, we did something we’d never tried before, prepped the ingredients, wrapped the gyoza, and created a gyoza production line. Every now and then, we would work together with someone new. We spoke with members we hadn’t seen in a long time while covered in flour, we ate gyoza with our families, and the day flew by.\nOur event organizer and Impact HUB Tokyo co-founder, Shino, reminds us, “Even in a space like this, it is important to continue nurturing a vibrant community”. There are times when a community can move unrelentingly towards a vision, which can cause friction and tension. In those moments, it is essential to inject a controlled chaos in to the community to shake things up. The gyoza making has its inherent meaning, the Impact HUB Tokyo adapted it to the organization’s style.\nInto the future of coworking spaces–Community is a new Laboratory. Impact HUB Tokyo has since evolved from its original model as a coworking space. What we are focusing on now is continuing our own personal development. We observe the community, observe changes, and take in news before introducing experimental initiatives.\nRecently within the kitchen space we’ve introduced a new accelerator program, “Kitchen Lab Course”, aimed at entrepreneurs who are thinking of launching food related businesses (such as lunch, dinner, catering or bento deliveries). In addition, we have a scholarship program, “Entrepreneur In Residence”, for seasoned entrepreneurs who have experience setting up a number of businesses, and “Startup In Residence” for startups which are in the process of establishing their business model. Impact HUB Tokyo’s founder has also continued challenging new ventures that will allow us to learn through the management of this space, develop new concepts, and implement new visions.\nHere at Impact HUB Tokyo we believe that “community” is a new laboratory. The various challenges and experiments, and the discoveries and changes we make will not develop from an environment that has its heart locked up. We also cannot say that it is sustainable to depend on a single superstar “entrepreneur” for innovation. Here at Impact HUB Tokyo, we will continue to look out for future signs and evolve with the community.\n This piece is a translation from Impact HUB Tokyo’s original post “Vol. 3 Impact HUB Tokyoの日常” with permission.\nWriter/Editor: Ishikawa Koumei (石川孔明) Translator: Levana Lam\n"});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/docs/hong-kong/appcoda/','title':"AppCoda",'section':"Hong Kong",'content':"Creating one of the world’s leading iOS tutorial platforms out of a side blog — AppCoda Archive Date: April 19, 2018\nEvery week, we feature one entrepreneur or startup in East Asia that we respect. This week, we interviewed Simon Ng, Founder and Chief Editor of AppCoda, a leading iOS development tutorial platform.* In our interview with Simon, we covered his entire journey with AppCoda for the past 5 years, which we’ll be separating in to 2 parts: Product and Business Development. Read on to find out how he developed his blog side project into a a full-time publication as a solopreneur.*\nSimon works on AppCoda at a local co-working space in Kowloon, Hong Kong. Unfortunately, we conducted the interview over a casual lunch and didn’t record it, but it turns out that Simon, a Hong Kong native, isn’t often interviewed in person.\nHow did you get started with AppCoda?\nSimon: Well, I liked programming, but I didn’t get to do much development in my day job. I got bored and wanted to teach myself something new. When Objective C was introduced for the App Store around 2011, I started teaching myself as an exercise. I developed my first app in about 6 months and discovered that X-Code was quite good for developing a full product. Previously, even teaching yourself to code for the web required a lot of knowledge (Java, JS, HTML), and the first projects you’re taught — Hello World — just don’t look that appealing. Objective-C and the Xcode integrated development environment (IDE) changed all that by making development more integrated, visually appealing to beginners, and also easier to pick up and create something new with relatively quickly.\nWhy did you specifically think of blogging about your project instead of just trying to create new apps that generated income?\nSimon: About 10 years ago, I started a blog that covered iPhone jail breakers and at its peak it had around 20,000 daily views. So I liked writing, sharing what I learned, and teaching (I taught courses at the Open University at one point). I get a lot of satisfaction from teaching. A blog just seemed natural, although I didn’t action it for a few months.\nWhat did you do in between?\nI purchased the domain, created a splash landing to collect e-mail signups, and just sat on it for a while. I started to think about blogging in September 2011 and actually started in April 2012, when the mailling list piled up to 300+ subscribers. I figured I should actually write something.\nDo you remember your first blog post?\nI think it was why I was starting this new blog. ** Laughs* * I told my readers from my jail breaker blog that I was starting this new blog. The first tutorial was probably something like “Hello World”.\nGive us the goods — how did you grow AppCoda after you started?\nPart of it was timing. At the time, there was basically no-one who did tutorials for Objective-C, and when Swift was released in June 2014, I had a book out by October. There were O’Reily books and other guides, but they’re not as easy to pick up for a new developer who’s just curious. Now, there’s a lot of great online content to help people learn to code, not just for iOS — Udemy, Coursera, Treehouse, to name a few.\nAlso, I learned a lot from my first blog that helped me start on the right foot with AppCoda quickly:\n Collected emails from day 0 is essential and it’s still the main way I engage my readership Write regularly — I don’t know how I did it, but at the time, I committed to weekly Sunday posts. Writing as I was practicing was the best way to write because I could relate to the readers  What’s your differentiation, or what do you see as your product?\nMy product is how I share iOS coding tutorials. How the tutorials are presented is important. So for example, the formatting of text, screenshots for people to follow more easily, and demo code. To be honest, the AppCoda blog had a following, but it didn’t take off immediately and for a long time the jailbreaker blog was still much bigger.\nBut how did you manage to monetize AppCoda as a product if the traffic wasn’t that high?\nA lot of people feel that blogging income comes from placing ads and affiliate links. But if the traffic volume isn’t high, the money is never worth it and would never have replaced my day job. So instead, I tried to think of other ways to monetize the blog. But even that happened organically, and I can’t say I engineered it as a strategy.\nThe blog wasn’t my first paid product. At the time, making apps was big money. People sold source code (the same source code could create multiple apps). Do you remember the websites selling source code? So actually, my first paid product was selling my game app’s source code, and I included a user guide (which many other developers didn’t do). That generated some HK$ 100,000 in revenue. And my selling channel was the blog.\nSo you monetized organically through an ecosystem.\nBasically. I never made annual targets for growth or anything like that.\nBut since your iOS development tutorials were available for free online, how did you manage to become a published author?\nThe original idea came from a reader who said they loved my blog, but requested a PDF version for convenient offline reading on the iPad. I remember thinking, “Man, my tutorials are free and you’re still making demands?” I corresponded with him, and he was supportive saying that he would pay for the PDFs, but I didn’t really do anything about it for a while.\nSo when did you go full-time?\nAugust 2014. I started to hire freelance writers and began focusing on writing my own book. Before that, I read everything that Nathan Barry wrote. Nathan doesn’t write blogs much anymore, but he also developed a business model where he teaches people how to code and he shared how much revenue he makes. He still does. I read his entire guide before I wrote my book.\nSimon grew his content ecosystem from online to offline — Photo by Athena Lam If you have friends creating content, send this post to them so that they can also be inspired to monetize their creations!\n"});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/docs/hong-kong/bestbev/','title':"BestBev",'section':"Hong Kong",'content':"How to do guerilla business development for a new industry — BestBev Archive Date: April 19, 2018\nBestBev was born in March 2013, and within months had their first shipment of craft beer into Hong Kong. Since then, its Shaheen Budhrani, Shakib Pasha, and Arnold Lee have introduced a host of award-winning overseas beers and ciders into the Hong Kong market and acquired an industry competitor by the end of 2017. BestBev runs a traditional B2B import and distribution model to restaurants, bars, and hotels across Hong Kong and Shaheen shares how they did guerrilla business development and built industry relationships before the market got too hot.\nAll of the BestBev co-founders had full-time jobs. Tell us how you took the dive after meeting to start a business together. BestBev was incorporated in March 2013 and our first shipment arrived around June/July. My partner and I met through our day-jobs and immediately clicked over our love of craft beer. At the time, craft beer was already big in other global cities like London and New York, but Hong Kong is typically 5 years behind these markets in adopting trends. We were aware of a couple of potential competitors that had started, but no one had really made a huge splash in the market. There was clear opportunity to be had.\nI’ll say upfront, we didn’t do anything that innovative. We saw a huge gap in the market and felt it was crazy to not take the opportunity that was staring us in the face. Hong Kong has no tax on beer, so initial distribution for import was cheaper than brewing. Unlike other cities, where local brewing developed the craft beer culture, Hong Kong went the other way around.\nCan you quickly recap how you signed your first breweries and restaurants? Signing the deal for our first few breweries were quite easy as it was clear that breweries in the West were facing saturation points and were looking to expand abroad. The movement had already begun in Japan and there was some loose track record in Singapore, so it was easy to convince the breweries that Hong Kong would be able to pick up traction soon. We convinced them we were in it for the long run and had a strong sense of wanting to invest in brand building as opposed to ‘trading’.** **\nIts absolutely essential to understand that every customer is different, especially at the beginning. We segmented and changed our approach for each one.** **\nFulfilling orders often reveals huge gaps in operations. How was your first experience of delivering an order? We were more interested in the physical sale and only very late understood the need to collect payments on orders that were going out. We just got so excited to deliver and grow the distribution network.** **\nWe were all over the place in that first year. It was absolute chaos. We were selling hard when that first batch arrived, then we opened up the warehouse management system, and we had enough stock to last us 1 week. We had to do a lot of customer management to ease our demand and ensure they would still be our customers when subsequent orders arrived.\nHow were you sure that craft beer was a viable market in Hong Kong? Craft beer was already mature in other global cities. Even though Hong Kong didn’t have it yet, there were people who had interest (such as expats). Since we were basically the first to open our doors, it was like squeezing a lemon that had been around for ages. The orders just kept coming because at first we were the only ones and that meant we were talking to buyers from hotels and operations directors from restaurants.\nHow did you position yourself and get to become distributor for community and arts events? Very good question. I think because both my partner and I came from trading backgrounds, we understood the need to make the business more of a social connector and a ‘provider of good times’ as such. We didn’t want to be just traders. We wanted to connect with movers and shakers in the industry and more importantly have that level of association with great establishments.\nNow, a few years later, it’s a saturated market. If you’re trying to start an import business now and talking to the buyers from hotels, they have all the craft suppliers.\nLooking back, how have you managed to secure a market for BestBev once competitors started sprouting up? Strong relationships and constant innovation of the portfolio. We jumped from smaller breweries to slightly larger and by then we had relationships with up and coming breweries in the West. As soon as they picked up big awards or got traction we could convince them that we were the right partner for them. The market now is highly overcrowded. There are already 20+ local breweries.\nWhat’s one of the biggest barriers building business relationships for you? In Hong Kong, a lot of the people we met didn’t think about quality. It was all about cost. We spoke to people in charge of buying or operations for international hotels that were convinced by legacy marketing. Squeezing into a market with people who had been sold a message from well known international beer brands for 60 years was tough. Now, if you were going to start importing and talking to the buyer now from hotels, they wouldn’t be interested anymore for another reason — they have all the craft beer suppliers already.\nCan you give examples of milestone partnerships you secured? One achievement is that we supply Beef \u0026amp; Liberty. We met the operations director even before they opened into Hong Kong and are still working with them today. They’re opening their next branch at the Hong Kong Airport, which is exciting for us as it’s our first presence in the airport.\nAnother big win was turning a confrontational situation into a business opportunity with one of the high-end supermarkets in Hong Kong. Basically, we found that they were parallel importing a different size of a product we had and notified them about it. There’s no law in Hong Kong against parallel imports, so they had no intention to remove the product. But since we did get an e-mail back directly from the relevant department, we couldn’t pass up the opportunity to continue the conversation. We approached them, dropped the dispute, showed them our portfolio and basically asked, “Is there something else that we could offer you?” Something in our portfolio piqued interest — an Australian cider range. It was a long vetting and testing process, but 8 months later our products were on their shelves.\nWhat were your business development milestones? As Director of Sales, many of my milestones went with sales:\n 100 invoice because it shows traction first 100k in sales because it proves there’s a market hitting our target in monthly recurring revenue hitting the target for the year  Did any of those help you decide to go full-time? A lot of factors came together. I didn’t see an opportunity to grow with my job and basically the scales tipped for me. It was also financially possible for me to do so. The company had a budget that showed I could return up to 3 times on the investment in my salary within the first quarter of my coming full time.\nThere was a clear roadmap for on how we could grow sales if we put in the hours. I made the transition not after we hit a number, but in order to hit our targets. After I went full time, we were pretty cash tight for a few months to pay my salary, but we got there.\nYou were in charge of business development. What skills did you apply most to secure deals? I once interned at a company and was given a phone book where I made 100+ calls a day to sell to high-net worth individuals. A few months after I started, I closed a deal within 72 hours and made the record for the fastest intern to every do so. That job was very good training to learn what words get responses, how to keep someone on the line, and also how to move on quickly. You can’t teach that skill. You just have to do it. I applied the skills I learned in that job for sales here.\nSales, the people going out there and doing the talking, has a feel for the market. For example you know you can get another 10-20k / month by doubling the number of calls/meetings. You get to know the seasonal trends only after 3 years. The first 2 years, it’s impossible to have a budget — an entrepreneur who gives you one is winging it. There’s too much seasonality and variation, and not enough data to go on. It’s only years 3-5 that you have a budget to stick to to guide growth.\nAny other avenues of business development that you pursued? Events and collaborations with local artists. We saw more engagement on our online store and greater B2C revenue growth in months where we focused on content and event collaborations. This was a no brainer as we have higher margins in this model.\nDown the road, I also co-invested in Coaster Magazine with a former BestBev sales executive who wanted to get back into writing. Before working with us, she was an editor for TimeOut. When she first started Coaster Magazine, I was very involved, but later I had to step back and take a more hands-off investor approach. The publication isn’t a marketing initiative and BestBev never focused on marketing, but the magazine has also raised public interest in craft beer, which is good for the industry.\nWhat learnings would you pass on to fellow entrepreneurs? For example, businesses in large markets like the US would think that HK$2-4 million (US$300,000-500,000) per year is small when you’re hustling every single day. But for entrepreneurs in smaller markets like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Cambodia, Vietnam, US$500,000 is pretty good. Entrepreneurs have to celebrate milestone victories because it means progress and going forward.\nBy the end of 2017, BestBev acquired a larger competitor, AmeriCraft Imports and combined the two importers’ portfolios. Shaheen has taken a backseat and given the role of Managing Director to one of his co-founders.\n"});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/docs/hong-kong/eoniq/','title':"EONIQ",'section':"Hong Kong",'content':"Creating revenue-generated growth for EONIQ through need finding Archive Date: May 3, 2018\nFounded in the summer of 2014, EONIQ is a custom watch brand founded in Hong Kong and that was the first to create customized mechanical watches that are designed by users on its website.

Some were the right ones, some were not. By the time I got my first watch working it was already around the 6th months.\nFrom making your own watch to a unique brand experience where users can design and customize their own watches using a web app. How did you get there? My previous side business was Kairos Design. In that business, the model was customer-to-watch designer matching. Each watch would cost upwards of HK$30,000. While doing that business I learned that one of the most inefficient parts of the process was the iteration and communication between designers and customers. I went ahead and created an app to make it more efficient. It turned out this also make things scalable; thus EONIQ was born.\nHow did you originally think of the app as an interface between you and a customer? How has that view evolved? Originally it was functional: it needs to make the communication of the design efficient, and the preview accurate enough for the customer to iterate and get feedback. Now it is more emotional: it’s about a smooth, enjoyable, not intimidating process of designing one’s own unique watch/gift.\nWhat counts as a product for EONIQ? EONIQ’s product is innovative because it is more than just a watch. It is an experience that involves a customer, but in a way that is easy for them to get onboard. An app helps the customer successfully design and create their own watch by streamlining the process. We do the heavy lifting in creating it.\nEverything that the user will associate with your brand counts. That includes your marketing, store placement, customer service, after sales, emotional association (branding), etc. Product is just one part of customer experience.\nHow did you do user interviews and how did you know what feedback to optimize your product as 1) the watch and 2) the app? How did you do customer discovery and learn why customers would buy your product? We do need finding exercises for both prospective e customers and actual customers. Need finding is part of design thinking, something I specialized in at the Stanford D-School. We do 20+ minute interviews on top of user behavior tracking online (scrolling heat map, button click tracking), social media listening and experiments.\nOur approach works quite similarly for the watch and the app. For example, the user’s behavior on the website tells me both which styles they prefer, and the UX they prefer. The reason both the UX and the watches require interviews is because that is where we can see their non-verbal communications cues on their actual feelings about our product.\nWhat data do you collect and why? Based on the data collected, how do you prioritize what to iterate on? We collect anything that we can. But we are data inspired, not data-driven. We are user need driven.\nHow were you able to continually optimize your product market fit? Need finding. The more we know our customers, the more we can create campaigns that speak to them. All the details, such as timing, discounts given, channels to focus on, or even what video clips and which second of the video to have a popup are all user need-driven.\nTechnology has been integral to your product, but you have also used it very strategically. Can you share more about your approach to technology? Technology is just a tool. We design our user experience around customers’ needs. If they need a more verbal type of communication, we use chatbot, for example. If we think they need to see more tailored ads based on their progress in the Consumer Decision Journey, we give out ads based on their behaviors on our website.\nOptimizing business funnels and expanding to new markets Since then, EONIQ has expanded beyond Hong Kong. How did you choose the new markets you were entering? Mostly based on data, depending on the customer acquisition cost (CAC) for different countries. We design types of content based on different countries’ social media behaviours, and we test and try to obtain the best CAC for each country. As long as the CAC make sense we grow that pie.\nHow do you do research to find a new market? Interviews. Goes back to the need-finding topic. I find different ppl in HK (from different places, different demographics, to interview) and same for other markets.\nHow did you keep iterating your organization for growth? Can you give an example of a series of hypotheses you tested and what data points you found? Way too many. We work week to week to improve our funnels and each of the team heads is iterating on hypotheses: from details as small as asking “HM on FB because they want the watch or if it is just a common user behaviour?” to considerations as bit as how to address users wanting our product line A over line B, but that line A is more difficult to design so line B sells better.\nHow was building trust from customers? Takes time. In our line of business, most people buy once. (For now).\n Omnipresence (give them impression from as many traction channels as possible) Brand/KOL endorsement Follower base interaction Product reviews Warranty and customer services  Any final tactics* (not tips) for fellow entrepreneurs in Asia? Social media is getting a lot more expensive. If a new entrant fails in doing need finding and experiments just with money and data, it will be close to mission impossible.\nEONIQ is co-founded by Quinn Lai and Charles Wong and the company now has a 16-person team serving 60+ countries worldwide and over 1 million watches designed on the platform. They have gone from online-to-offline with a physical retail store and now also hold workshops and experiences for customers.\n"});index.add({'id':5,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/docs/hong-kong/helpergo/','title':"Helper Go",'section':"Hong Kong",'content':"Building a revenue-driven product in 2 years — Sam Ng on HelperGo Part 1 Archive Date: October 8, 2018\nBrief: In 2015, Sam Ng was onto his third company after two failed startups in two years. Fast forward to 2018 and Sam’s third company, HelperGo had investment from 500 Startups and reached profitability. Sam’s fourth company was already raising Series A and he had exited to work on his fifth startup, which had already secured investment. Sam sat down with us to share the gritty details of developing HelperGo. Part 1 covers how his approach to product development has evolved.\n It wasn’t failing his first startup, or his second startup, that taught Sam Ng how to build products. It wasn’t even securing investment for his third startup, HelperGo. Sam started our conversation by saying that he finally started to figure it out only after talking to hundreds of founders when he spent 6 months in Silicon Valley.\nSam Ng’s journey to HelperGo was not a straightforward one. Born in Hong Kong, he had spent over a decade in Australia, studied engineering, and worked in the industry before returning to his home city. By 2013, he had a secure full-time job and the startup market was already hot — not a good time for a newbie to wade in. He kept his job through his first two startup attempts and he cited lack of focus and software QA issues from outsourcing that resulted in failures. Undeterred, Sam pitched a third idea to the Hong Kong Science and Technology Park (HKSTP), where it got funding. Taking his previous learnings to heart that a startup needed full-time commitment, Sam quit his FinTech job to work with his two co-founders on this third idea.\nWe interviewed Sam from the office of his fifth startup, located at Sheung Wan’s NakedHub. We drilled down into his approach to building product for HelperGo, an online marketplace app for home services. We conducted the interview in Cantonese. Below, are Sam’s answers to how HelperGo evolved as a marketplace product that people will pay for.\nWhat counts as “product” to you? To me, product and service are different. Product is what people are willing to pay for. Customer service is separate. A lot of people say service is part of product, but you can have no customer service and still have a good product (like Whatsapp). Product should be a self-encapsulated thing that gives its users value.\nHow do you structure your team around your approach to product? A product owner is very important. That is the person who decides the direction, and is the spirit of the company. Of course, the direction can change, but you usually stick to a plan for 3-6 months. That person needs a lot of experience. They need to have seen a lot of products, be interested in human behaviour, and have an understanding of people.\nHelperGo as a product is a marketplace. The technical side for HelperGo isn’t difficult. Fundraising for marketplaces is the most important part because critical mass is essential for network effect to take place and ensure long-term sustainability.\nThe different product natures will have different team structures. But in the case of HelperGo as a marketplace, a finance person becomes super important. Of course, the CEO, who may or may not be the same person, is important because that person sets the expansion plan, which then affects your fundraising. Each fundraising round and valuation is also critical; how much you raise is like how many shots you’ve stocked up to do things right and get to the next round.\nIn addition, people are needed to build a marketplace — business development people, which means management of people essential. A company like Hong Kong’s Lalamove is now a company with over 5000 people [across China and Southeast Asia], so how do you manage such a rapidly growing company?\nFor HelperGo, I was the product owner but I had to grow into the role on the job. When we founded the company, there were 3 people: myself, Raymond as CTO, and business person with an SME background. None of us had startup experience, but as a team we were a good fit for the product needs.\nIf your app is the product for an end user, what type of interface did you want it to be? HelperGo’s interface is all about trust. A user is letting someone into their home. The app is there to standardize the market for services such as care giving, house cleaning, or maintenance, and it’s a long education process for users to overcome their skepticism. So even though the app’s core value should be to make the matching process for service providers with people who need them convenient, standardized, and automated, having a human touch is important. The app’s value alone cannot change mindsets to drive adoption, so we needed to humanize the app to get people to feel they can trust it.\nCan you elaborate on why you don’t consider customer service as part of product? Service isn’t part of the product, but at the same time, business requires a service component to survive. For HelperGo, our service included having the service provider (say cleaner) phone the client immediately after they accepted a job. It shouldn’t be necessary because the app has all the necessary details, such as your scheduled arrival time. But having that human voice to confirm makes a difference for a user.\nWe also build trust through a 100% satisfaction guarantee. Most cases are fine, so you just want to cover the worst case scenarios. Usually, you can shoot for the 80-20 rule. As long as you work out a system where you can get 80% satisfied people for as little effort as possible while honouring the 20% of unsatisfied people, it should be sustainable.\nDid you have a persona when you started and how did you do customer discovery? No, we didn’t have a persona at first. It has to be a data-driven approach. That also means you need money to acquire customers to acquire data, to create a persona, to fine tune the product (goes back to fundraising). Many people in Hong Kong feel like you can build an app for HK$200-300,000, so why did we invest so much more than that?\nWe made the investment because the process of building the right product is difficult. We had to put in money to make a more expensive product to learn how to iterate better. But there is the problem that people don’t have time to really give you the information to improve. Especially our users. Our target users would use our app when they’re waiting for something or on the bus. They use apps to not make calls. Of course, we tried phone calls to ask people about areas of improvement, but they’re costly and not that effective. User interviews gave some insights, but they ultimately were not as useful as the data we learned to collect on the platform itself.\nBut often people want to collect user feedback to improve a product. How did you learn to improve yours? We rarely directly interface with our paying customers because they don’t really want to be reached. We might phone some customers to ask how they found the service. For first time users, we would phone and ask, “What did you think of the service? Would you continue to have this person?” We wrap up in 3 questions. Segmenting users does help retention, but it’s nonetheless time-consuming, so we only do samples.\nI don’t think user interviews are always a good thing; talk to your customer is what everyone says, but it’s not that great. Everyone says they want options, so you give them options. But then they don’t know how to pick and make a decision. We ultimately went from giving people the option to input their own prices, to providing a range of prices, to 3 prices, to no choice in price (we set it). B2C people don’t know what they want. If you talk to them you get feedback, but it might not be useful.\nIf you could go back, how would you develop your product differently? Building data collection and analytics into the product from the get-go would have saved us a lot of pain in adding it back later and given us critical insights in our first year. We eventually built analysis into the product. We built in feedback features such as asking 3 survey questions after someone has used the service, using Google to find out user information, such as our customers like to travel, using heat maps, and tracking referrals.\nCan you share one of your biggest challenges? What learning can you share based on that? Actually, if I were to go back, I would hire a team in China. Talent is too expensive in Hong Kong. The founding team’s knowledge of how to build the product is super important. But there are other needs when the team grows bigger, such as fundraising, admin, and marketing, but it’s impossible to hire people in Hong Kong. For my new business, we’re hiring in China even though we have no connections. In Hong Kong, all the brightest people go to the banks.\nNo startup in Hong Kong can afford the prices of full-stack engineers or people with startup experience and are willing to go hands-on. On the other hand, there’s a lot more opportunity and talent in China. In Hong Kong, you don’t have that talent diversity. The team we assemble needs to be able to adapt rapidly to change.\n"});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/docs/hong-kong/launchpilots/','title':"LaunchPilots",'section':"Hong Kong",'content':"Launchpilots’ multiple iterations until proof of concept to land investment Archive Date: April 22, 2018\nIn 2011, Jah Ying Chung had organized 300 activities across 20 provinces in China for an NGO, and also helped university student groups get sponsorships from brands like Nike. Getting sponsorships was a common painpoint for all student group and Jah Ying realized there was a market need. She first addressed this need by setting up an NGO that ran workshops to support student organisers and eventually pivoted to an online marketplace. Launchpilots as a platform was launched in 2012 and rapidly expanded to China, and was acquired by Robin 8 in 2017. This post documents documents the first stage of Launchpilot’s many iterations towards product market fit that attracted angel investment.\nDiscovering a problem and getting instant market feedback In 2011, Jah Ying Chung, as the China Program Coordinator for 350.org had finished organizing national-level environmental campaigns in China. She had also been an active student organizer as a university student and understood the universal funding problem. Initially, she ran workshops to help organizers navigate applying for sponsorships and thought of using a non-profit model. After running workshops and events for about a year and getting to know more social enterprises in Hong Kong, she eventually arrived at the idea of an online marketplace.\nTo test her idea, Jah Ying wrote a single page site with the idea to collect signups and e-mailed student groups to confirm that there really was a market need. The e-mails got a 60% open rate and 30% signup rate, which is quite high especially for a site without a working prototype. When she posted the site on Facebook, it attracted signups from student groups even in the UK, Malaysia, and the Middle East in addition to her target Hong Kong market. This was enough market feedback to try to build a product.\nCreating the first iteration As a solo founder, Jah Ying bootstrapped and looked for developers in the Hong Kong startup community to help her work on the project for free. The platform’s most basic features should be allowing student groups to sign up, create events, and apply for sponsorships. Ideally, there would be the same for brands as well. Beginning with UX the initial questions were:\n What were the student user stories and user journeys? What were brand user stories and user journeys?  After the UX was mapped out, the minimum viable product (MVP) needed to be built. However, the product consisted of an on-platform (tech) side and an off-platform (offline, sales) side. The two needed to be built in parallel to create a critical mass of demand.\n On-platform (website): refining the landing page to optimize signup rates and optimize SEO, while also building a content management system (CMS) and backend admin panel to see users Off-platform (sales): signing on brands and reaching out to more student groups  Getting enough student groups signed up provided user numbers that could get meetings with brand marketing departments. By June 2012, they had about 300 visits per month and around 50 registered users and events. The traction was modest, but growing.\nOn the brand side, Jah Ying needed to close a deal with a brand to anchor what she could sell to the student groups who hadn’t already signed up. One of the challenges was finding a way to package this innovative way of marketing to students, which didn’t fall neatly into categories such as “social media marketing” or even “influencer marketing”. The idea was that brands would pay Launchpilots to select suitable student groups to partner with and market to — such as a sports association if it was an athletic wear company. But how could Launchpilots guarantee reach and how would they charge? Would this new product be a fixed cost for a successful sponsorship facilitated or should it be charged for a time-based campaign for x number of students? The discussion with brands would drag out through the Spring of 2013.\nWith the longer business development cycle with the brands, it would be a while before LaunchPilots closed enough deals with brands to sustain even one full-time employee. Jah Ying would need a salary to continue operations and also bring in more team members. Jah Ying applied, and was accepted, to the China Accelerator 2013 cohort. The accelerator would give Launchpilots initial funding and the management team might be able to help the company refine the product and make business introductions. In June 2013, Jah Ying and her technical team member, Hubert, went off to Dalian.\nProof of concept and funding validation During the summer at China Accelerator, Jah Ying and Hubert could work on the platform full-time to add essential business features:\n Adding a Chinese version to the site Bring a steady stream of brands in China and Hong Kong, targeting one deal a week Get traction to gear up for a first angel round of funding after the accelerator streamline the student group onboarding process gear up for Orientation Camp (O-Camp) for the incoming university students and a successful experience with one of their first major brands, Red Bull.  By the time they graduated from the accelerator, Launchpilots already had a small cash flow of revenue. Though the amount did not even cover one person’s monthly salary, the closed deals were proof-of-concept.\nNarrowing down core products for brand-student engagement success Screenshot of Launchpilots’ website and student-led Facebook campaigns. With its first few brands signed on, LaunchPilots was able to close its first round of funding shortly after graduating from China Accelerator in the Fall of 2013. The round of angel investors were impressed by Jah Ying’s ability to execute, from signing on brands to sharing weekly results. The Launchpilot Weekly Update e-mails included clear updates on investment, talent recruitment, focus of the week, product development, customer development, student user growth, and hypotheses for new experiments and campaigns. These reflections and proactive engagements encouraged supporters to make investor or business referrals even when they were not directly involved in the funding round.\nAfter the funding round closed, the cash injection helped Launchpilots grow the team to scale the business and streamline the sponsorship process. Jah Ying had already been identifying potential team members who she thought had a mission and cultural fit and would also fulfil key business development, student growth, and engineering roles.\nIn 2014, Launchpilots was rapidly expanding from Hong Kong to China and Taiwan, two markets that had their own needs and opportunities. Jah Ying had brought on a full-time team in China and was two part-time team members in Taiwan. The company’s next step would be to figure out whether it could offer streamlined products for brands across the three markets.

Founded by innovator, environmental activist, and entrepreneur Cesar Harada, MakerBay has since evolved to become a community hub and incubator for makers, startups, and innovators. By 2018, MakerBay had expanded to Central’s PMQ, moved HQs to a multi-storey Tsuen Wan building, collaborated with the Hong Kong Jockey Club to open 6 young makerspaces, and designed maker workstations for schools throughout the city. Below is the story of MakerBay’s earliest days of business development to survive cashflow shortages and get operations off the ground.\nWhy start in the first place? In the Fall of 2014, Cesar Harada had a happy problem with his first startup, Scoutbots: he had a new investor who put in cash to help him manufacture the latest iteration of his product, open hardware shape-shifting sailing robot called Protei featured on TED.com. Cesar’s problem was that he was working out of a small workshop that he had built in a suburb of Hong Kong — he needed a larger workshop to produce enough units.\nAs a cash-strapped solo founder, the seemingly simple solution was to share the workshop space with the other makers in the small Hong Kong community. The math seemed relatively straight forward to have a few additional tenants to either split or entirely cover the cost of the rental space. It seemed like a win-win situation where makers as members could finally share resources like woodworking tools, a laser cutter, or CNC machine. Cesar would also finally have a community to collaborate with, hub of ideas and positive, creative energy.\nHigh stakes and cashflow crunches The challenges were also just as easy to spot: the small upfront cash investment would at least help Cesar write the cheques to sign the lease, but his cashflow would run out within 2-3 months if he could not find enough tenants. As one of the most expensive cities to rent in the world, signing a lease is one of the biggest risks any Hong Kong startup can take. In addition, quick calculations on profits from office space and individual memberships quickly revealed a bigger math problem: even at full capacity, the profit margin was not high. On the flip side, increasing the membership cost too much would not be feasible.\nCesar was keenly aware of the cashflow risk and began to share his idea with makers even as he was looking for workshop spaces. Many expressed initial interest, but location would be the main concern. There was only one unit in a Yau Tong factory that fitted his requirements and budget, and it would be a tough location sell for most people living in more central areas of Hong Kong.\nCo-creating a community space The challenge of starting MakerBay quickly became a chicken and egg problem. Makers and even companies were not willing to commit until they knew the location and saw the renovations. On the other hand, MakerBay as a new company using cash from the Scoutbots investor, needed other tenants’ commitments to mitigate the risk.\nAs he hadn’t signed a lease yet, he instead took his own detailed unit measurements to create a 3D model render to share with the community. Counter to the typical co-working space business model of unveiling impressive facilities in central business districts, Cesar took the radically grassroots approach of inviting the community to the raw, unrenovated unit, for input. He shared plans for a woodworking space, a biohacking space, metal work, an open area with fixed desks, and one wall of smaller 50 square feet units.\nIn January 2015, Cesar had to bite the bullet and commit to the lease. Eventually, after months of discussion, Cesar convinced fellow entrepreneur and inventor Shawn Frayne, co-founder of Looking Glass Factory, to join as his first large tenant in January 2015. With the initial agreement, Cesar signed the lease to the Yau Tong factory unit and would receive the keys on February 1st to begin renovations.\nBuilding From Scratch to Balance the Books As an experienced maker and having built his own workshop from scratch (including cabling), Cesar lead the charge to do renovations for the Yau Tong unit to make ends meet. The 7800 square foot space he had just leased was in poor condition and needed a full renovation from tearing down walls to new ventilation and toilets. MakerBay solicited quotes from several local contractors, trimmed to bare minimum requirements such as the the AC and toilets and made do.\nCesar’s hands-on approach helped save on renovation costs, but was met with skepticism from many locals. Part way through renovation, Cesar was already running short on cash. Though other co-working spaces, startup networks, investors, and multinational corporations, and even the Hong Kong government were interested in MakerBay as a concept, but few were willing to sign up for a membership. They wanted to see what the finished space was like first. MakerBay would have to find investment to buy buffer time as basic renovation costs and rent continued to bleed cash.\nOnboarding Partners As Cesar was looking for a rental space, he was speaking to investors in parallel. In 2014, Cesar had better chances of getting financial support leveraging his global TED network than talking to local investors, few of whom had hardware, open-source, or grassroots maker experience. He had discussions with other maker communities, such as the founders of MakerBar in Taipei, New Lab in New York and MakerLabs in Vancouver to learn what revenue models worked for them (or didn’t) and how they managed their communities. Tapping into the global community gave insight and emotional support, but Hong Kong was an untested market. Cesar ultimately decided that his vision for MakerBay was not entirely aligned with some of the global makerspace brands that were interested in opening franchises in Hong Kong.\nAfter his discussions with global investors fell through, Cesar eventually secured two local angel investment loans shortly after renovations began. They would help with cash flow for about another quarter as he worked to recruit more members.\nCreating a Maker Ecosystem Though MakerBay memberships covered its rental costs within a few months of opening, Cesar used his first company multiple times to pump money into MakerBay to pay salaries for program staff and keep the community space afloat in its first year. Instead, he didn’t draw a salary for the next 3 years and relied on other related channels to earn revenue and nurture a maker culture. Cesar was receiving requests to run workshops or corporate training events, while also teaching at an international school. He developed a trademark for designing projects that paired the latest technologies (such as an AR Sandbox) with at affordable approaches that use open-hardware and open-data. The products were relevant to locals and raise environmental awareness, such as a marine litter detective, or ocean plastic optical sensor, and ultimately incubated makers and entrepreneurs to pursue their passions.\nThe engagements outside of MakerBay raised interest in the space and attracted a trickle of members. At the same time, they built demand for a new product: lessons that taught people to be makers. As a result, MakerBay emerged with a hybrid income model that included offices, fixed desks, on-site workshops, as well as off-site educational programs.\nIn Spring of 2018, MakerBay had outgrown its old location and moved to a multi-storey building in Tsuen Wan. In 3 short years, it has also designed portable workbenches to put in schools or community spaces, advised and designed makerspaces, and built partnerships with local leading organizations such as the Jockey Club and been invited to organize events for spaces such as the Citizen Science Faire. Cesar has also spoken about his work at MakerBay in his TEDTalk “How I Teach Kids to Love Science”.\n"});index.add({'id':8,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/docs/hong-kong/ooosh/','title':"Ooosh for Startups",'section':"Hong Kong",'content':"由荔枝角到觀塘再戰私募基金 Ooosh for startups：客戶成功才是王道！ By : Ten Tang Archive Date: July 4, 2018\n客戶成功(Customer Success)不是軟件即服務(SaaS)的專屬名詞！一間在香港的共享工作室，亦憑著「客戶成功才是王道」的經營哲學，不但在短短兩年間擴展到觀塘，更加踩過界大搞私募基金和新創孵化器，致力培養本土的新創公司。這些都是Jeffrey和他的團隊努力的成果。\n不怕蝕底，才能與顧客建立長遠的關係 Ooosh for startup 在2016年成立，是一間紮根在荔枝角的共享工作室。短短兩年，Ooosh就吸引了超過50個初創團隊在這10,000尺的空間裡工作。Jeffrey是Ooosh的創辦人，他坦言剛開始的時候，自己在這個行業沒有資源也沒有人脈， 能夠吸引初創公司在Ooosh, 他靠的是四個字 — 不怕蝕底。\n「剛開始的時候我們也不太清楚如何能夠幫助初創團隊，所以我常常強調，我們能做到的就是不要計較，我們的職責就是讓他們能夠在這個地方舒舒服服地工作。Be a giver。例如說有人要用會議室但沒有預約，我們會照讓他用，大家溝通好下次用前先預約就好了。」Jeffrey的giver哲學就為他贏了租客的心 — 不但有好幾個團隊打從Ooosh初開張的時候就一直在此工作至今，租客們都非常樂意向朋友介紹Ooosh 。\n顧客的成功就是我的成功 Jeffrey在經營Ooosh的時候，大部份的心思都花在如何讓租客可以「有嘢攞走」。而社群管理就是重要的一環。Jeffrey打從一開始就意識到社群的重要性，因為唯有當志同道合的人聚在一起的時候，才能帶起互相學習、互相支持的氛圍。所以Ooosh的團隊在找租客時，很有策略地對準科技新創：一來新創團隊的思想一般比較開明，二來新創團隊的工作很相類似，較容易有共同的話題。\n「我最開心的，不是簽了有多大的單，而是租客可以在Ooosh學習到新的知識、有新的啓發可以應用在業務上。」以Ooosh 開業以來最成功的例子，莫過於有位做產品採購的租客，在與其他租客交流時學到了不少軟件開發的知識，因而聘請了程式人員開發了一個簡化作業流程的軟件，拓展業務。\n不要只往金錢看，顧客的素質也很重要 Jeffrey很清楚共享工作間的價值，並不在於它所提供的空間，而是這裡的人脈資源。「講真，香港雖然有土地問題，但公司仍有很多選擇：他大可以租一個在工廈的小單位，又或者租一些大型的服務式辦公室。他們為何要選擇你小小的一間共享工作室呢？要吸引他們來，就要能夠提供額外的價值。」因此當Ooosh的團隊招攬租客時，金錢不是唯一的指標；他們希望在Ooosh的租客都是能夠接受新思新的人，這樣才能夠建立一個健康和長遠的社群。\n「通常我們對那些很踴躍地問問題、對周遭的環境抱有好奇心的準租客會特別落力推銷；而性格比較惡劣的，沒有辦法，我們通常都不會招呼他們。」Jeffrey對的顧客素質堅持是有回報的。現時Ooosh的會員不但相處融洽、時有交流，每當有新會員加入的時候，他們更會主動地歡迎新成員，甚至比Jeffrey更加熱情！\n知多一點 客戶成功一詞的來由：因為軟件即服務的收費模式多為月費訂閱(Monthly Subscription)，所以客戶的忠誠度對他們的收入有很大的影響。而他們發現要提高客戶的忠誠度，只談容戶服務是不足夠的，讓客戶用了你的產品後變得成功才是關鍵！\n"});index.add({'id':9,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/docs/hong-kong/magic-sketch/part-1/','title':"Part 1: Monetisation",'section':"Magic Sketch",'content':"How this solopreneur monetized the right product after multiple wrong successes Archive Date: February 22, 2018\nPart 1 of an interview with UX/UI designer and solopreneur, James Tang, creator of the Sketch plug-in Magic Mirror (now Magic Sketch).

Why is that?\nI met Meng To, the UI / UX designer who wrote DesignCode, when we were working at a startup called Carshare together. He is an incredible UI/UX designer who helps other designers think technically using Swift and XCode. After we both moved on from Carshare, I helped revise part of his book about iOS development and UX design. It gave me a taste of how someone could successfully market and monetize their knowledge as a product. That’s when I began experimenting with my own blog. At the time, Medium was an up-and-coming blogging platform that was free, well-designed, and easy to use.\nRiding the wave with a different spin So you didn’t think too much about what types of blogging platforms to use?\nIf writing is like a product, then the blogging platform is the tool. Choosing the right one for your needs is important. I tried a lot of platforms and was looking for something that could use markdown (a plain text formatting syntax meant for export to HTML and other platforms) conveniently. I tried Ghost, Silvrback, Svbtle. I’d also considered a self-hosted Jekyll blog. In the end, I kept most of the content on Medium.\nJames shares his lifestyle experiments on Medium.\nFor technical writing, there are better platforms than Medium that have more markdown features.\nYes, but Medium is beautifully designed for reading and writing, and as a UX/UI designer, that matters to me. At the time, Medium was becoming popular, but there wasn’t much technical stuff written yet. I starting writing about iOS development because that’s what I knew and I was treated it like a public diary of things I was working on or learning. My technical pieces became a hit and my Medium followers, who could see my integrated Twitter account, started following me on Twitter as well.\nMeng was able to monetize because he knew his audience. He wrote for designers who wanted to code iOS apps. I wrote from the opposite perspective — for developers who want to understand and learn design hacks.\nStart with a learning attitude before thinking about growth Would it be fair to say that you only thought about growth after you started a new project? Yes, in my blogging and later products, I started because I wanted to try something. It was enough for me to finish a project or document my work in my blog, and in the beginning I didn’t have many followers.\nOf course I had generating income at the back of my mind when I started because I saw how Meng did it firsthand. But I realised I had a lot to learn about writing for the web after I started. I was lucky because I could learn directly from him for things like linking back to his content, choosing pricing, and engaging the online community throughout the process of writing an e-book.\nI also read a lot of articles explaining content marketing and blogging. I developed my Medium blogs based on trial and error and learned from other blogs, like my favourite technical writers. The best learnings were content from people that I knew, like Meng and Lifehack.org, content platform and company that another Hong Kong serial entrepreneur, Leon Ho, built from a personal blog. Knowing the people behind the product helped me see the effort that went into the content. Also, both of them are single founders, which is similar to how I work as a freelancer.\nWhat were some of the blog tips you picked up?\n Write good, useful content Create a high resolution cover image Write in point form Write a catchy title, but don’t be over the top or misleading Again, write good content – concisely  So you were writing for a hypothetical audience before you attracted your 1000+ Twitter following. As more people began to follow me – once I had 500+ Medium followers – I began profiling them on Twitter. Before that, I didn’t give myself the pressure to “growth hack” my publication. But once I had a more significant number, I knew people liked my stuff and I wanted to get know the community. Most of my readers were technical, so I got more engaged on Twitter to learn about things that other technical people would like. That’s like getting user feedback to get inspiration for the next feature for the next iteration of a startup app.\nCreating products that go with your learning flow James could often be found by the espresso machine at Blueprint HK, a coworking space run by Swire Properties.\nSo how did you choose what to teach yourself and share for iOS development and how did that end up leading to actual apps?\nLike many developers, I learn using open-source libraries and also open-source my own development projects. Writing and building features or even apps can go together once you get used to writing. At one point, I got really interested in creative UI/UX, navigation and gestures like the sidebar menu in the Facebook app, and pinch to create tasks in the Clear todo list app. Just before or around the release of Facebook 2.0 and Clear, my libraries were the earliest open-sourced projects that successfully mimicked their gestures. That library grew my followers from 10 to 300. You could say one of my first lucky breaks was building a product a the right time, so other developers discovered me. Once they did, they also discovered I wrote about my learnings as a developer.\nHow did you find inspiration for the products you were working on? Do you remember the MVP startup craze, when people created teaser videos with conceptual products to test out a market reaction before building? (Check this list of 5 MVP Startups)\nJames catching up with a fellow developer in Hong Kong.\nBasically, I was following those videos, and some concepts seemed to fun to try. From a UX/UI designer’s perspective, loved the seamless transition in Pinterest, fancy bouncing menu in Path, and the highly realistic textures and UI effects in Camera+. I wanted to try recreating them myself. So you could say I practiced creating products or features by reverse engineering them, and building my own open-source version.\nWhat would be your advice to someone else starting out alone? Stick with what you like. There’s so much stuff out there, and such limited time. Share your thoughts and let others know through blogging and tweeting. It’s better to go niche.\nLeveraging and pivoting are skills that need practice too You were associated with a recognized UX designer, Meng, had growing followers and contributed solid content to the dev community. Could you leverage all of that by the time you came up with a product? I tried to, but I failed. Because I was already contributing to Meng’s book, which sold well, I figured I could try writing a book of my own. I tried to build my content ecosystem by using a concrete iOS app as an example. I had experience blogging, writing a book, and writing iOS apps. Plus, I wanted readers to learn iOS design, development and promotion through a hands-on project (an new app I built).\nWhat product example did you write with? At the time, I was interested in productivity and had a desktop app on Mac App Store, so I adapted the Pomodoro Timer concept. It was the year Apple released the Apple Watch, so I made an iOS app that supported the iPhone and the Apple Watch.\nThe Pomodoro Timer app developed for Apple Watch Series 1 would be later rebranded as the iOS app “Today”. Image courtesy of James Tang\nHow did the writing go? Making the application turned out to be much more work than I originally expected. The app was simple, but it was really difficult to have one working example that would use all the technical topics I wanted to cover in a cohesive way. I decided to finish my app and see how well it did in the App Store before continuing writing the e-book. In the end, I stopped writing.\nSo about a year in, you had a decent following and a failed product. I put in some in-app purchases to monetize my Pomodoro app, but it didn’t seem like it was going to have sustainable revenue. I knew I had to find another product to generate income.\nHow did you take your learnings and improve on your next product? I didn’t exactly sit down and think: ‘What next startup product should I do next?’ I’m a developer who loves design and products, but at the same time I needed to earn a living. I’m not looking to build a startup team and raise investment funds.\nBut building the Pomodoro Timer app gave me insight into another pain point. I used Sketch for design, and there was a missing feature that I really wanted. I did some research and noticed that other competing design tools offered that feature, but no-one was trying to solve that for Sketch, which is now one of the most popular tools for UI / UX design and mockups. That’s when I knew I had something I wanted to explore.\nBasically, I wanted a tool that could do perspective transformation to do mockups (think of someone holding an iPhone at an an angle versus facing the screen). This existed in other platforms, which means that designers probably use it (market validation). But the growing Sketch community didn’t have it. As a developer, I wanted to solve my own problem and this time, unlike the Pomodoro App, I had a clear potential set of customers.\nIn the end, it worked out.\n"});index.add({'id':10,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/docs/asia/helping-hands-yangon/part-1/','title':"Part 1: Starting",'section':"Helping Hands Yangon",'content':"How this woman unwittingly became a female founder: Helping Hands Yangon Archive Date: January 18, 2018\nHow dogged persistence in prototyping for a personal project grew into minimum viable product (MVP) and became a social enterprise called Helping Hands Yangon. Learn how Annie founded this self-sustaining business after realizing there was demand in Myanmar for teak furniture and local Burmese handicrafts.\nThe women looked from their sewing machines to see who had walked through the 10-foot wooden doors. They smiled politely and went back to stitching the bags on the sewing machines. They had no pressure to please, nor guard be on guard for anyone who walked through the entrance. Their long workbench was lit by the ambient sunlight streaming in from the ceiling-high windows that gave them a view of the landscaped garden outside.\nOne woman with a serene smile approached me and asked if I was looking for someone. Within seconds, I heard a voice ricocheting through the cavernous ceiling and archways. It was Annie’s characteristic deluge of enthusiasm for something in the works. I said I had a meeting with the owner of the voice. This was her house, and also the headquarters for three NGOs/social enterprises that worked with Yangon’s street kids, ex-addicts, single mothers, and differently-abled.\nInterviewing Annie in her house which doubled as a workshop for Helping Hands — Photo by Athena Lam\nAnnie (I’m only using her given name to protect her privacy) drifted over to greet me, apologizing for taking a few extra minutes to wrap up another project meeting. Would I like a drink while waiting?\nBy the time I finished scanning her bookshelf, she had brought me a cup of coffee and we headed upstairs for a chat about her projects. After settling into the rattan chairs, Annie recounts her experiences in Yangon on the veranda with a view of the landscaped garden and garage-workshop I had walked past.\nThe origins of accidental business Local Burmese artisan refurbishing second-hand teak furniture — Photo Credit: Helping Hands\nBy the time I met with Annie in 2015, she was already well known for two social enterprises in Yangon: Helping Hands Yangon and Pomelo for Mynamar. She wanted to brainstorm scaling solutions for the NGOs and businesses she’d co-founded, as “business wasn’t her thing”. But, she had nonetheless stumbled on a product-market fit by naturally creating self-sustaining businesses to meet the demand and create job opportunities for locals. Why was business so natural for a self-professed NGO person more interested in discussing the nuance of social challenges locals face?\nOur hour-long afternoon discussion passed the golden hours as we delved into her journey as an unwitting female entrepreneur. Annie’s original two-year stay was approaching its seventh year by 2015. When she had first arrived, she had one major problem she worked on with dogged determination: furnishing her house.\nA personal passion makes an unwitting prototype Handmade bags by local Burmese at Helping Hands — Photo by Athena Lam\nIn 2008, Myanmar was still a closed economy and importing foreign furniture was not an option, or too expensive to be one. But there was no shortage of local supply. Teak furniture was lying around as discards because locals were tired of using the material. Though Annie could pick up used tables off the streets, she couldn’t use them. The weather-worn teak needed to be properly refurbished.\nBut Annie needed to furnish her house. She was also set on doing so with the abundant, high-quality teak. What was utterly lacking were appropriate finishing materials and willing skilled artisans. It took Annie months to find anyone who would help her restore the pieces she’d collected. After that, they had to continually test whatever wood finishing they could find in Yangon at the time on the teak to see if it was suitable for the humidity, protected the wood, and pleased the eye. This talent sourcing and product development took well over a year before Annie had her first usable prototype*, for which she was the sole customer.\nA ready product becomes a magnet for requests Annie’s refurbished furniture caught attention. The pieces I saw sitting in her house were also seen by other expats who visited and similarly loved the idea of giving high quality furniture a second life. Unlike Annie, they lacked her network of artisans to call on. Just by seeing her products (refurbished teak furniture), people began to ask for a service (access to the artisans). After taking a certain amount of orders, Annie looked into doing a formal business registration. With the establishment of a business, she and her business partner could graduate to formalized business operations and officially hiring artisans and the street youth whom Annie wanted to help.\nGrowing product lines Getting to know local Yangon on foot and by bus — Photo by Athena Lam\nForming the organization after the orders had become regular gave Annie and her team of artisans the space to organically grow without pressure to make ends meet. Every order that came in allowed them to refine aspects of the business such as the refurbishment process, taking orders, managing customer expectations, and also finding new apprentices. The modest growth also gave room for another development to take hold: expanding to another product line by employing seamstresses to create tote bags, tunics and other textiles.\nBringing a product to customers Now, with formal operations and more streamlined goods, Annie began to think beyond just passively meeting orders. How could more customers discover Helping Hands to sustain revenue, or even grow it? Because Helping Hands was designed as a business that brought employment to otherwise unemployed artisans and street youth, growing the business would directly impact more lives. With refurbishment services and textiles ready, Annie and her business partner could shift positions from finding talent, to finding customers.\nIn a country without regularly accessible or stable internet until around 2014, a traditional shop seemed like the next evolution of this business. In 2011, Annie and her business partner co-founded Pomelo for Mynamar, a retail store to showcase pieces created at Helping Hands as well as products from other Burmese artisan groups in rural areas.\nDistilling the unique value proposition to scale The entrance alcove is an informal shop corner for handmade shirts — Photo by Athena Lam\nHelping Hands now employs over 50 artisans and ex-street youth. Annie recognizes that establishing her Helping Hands early has given her an unwitting first-mover advantage. She is tempted by the opportunities to scale the positive impact on the communities, but recognizes the inherent risks of preserving the organization’s original culture and value propositions.\nBoth Helping Hands has a clear value proposition for its stakeholders, employees and customers. For buyers, they provide high quality local furniture, textiles, and handicrafts with proceeds that are transparently returned to the creators. For artisans, seamstresses, craftsmen and other local staff, they are able to find relatively stable income in a market rife with casual labour. Will Annie’s businesses be able to retain their unique value propositions when they scale? If yes, how?\nFor the locals, the benefits extend beyond direct monetary value to the organization’s investment in their livelihoods. In Part 2 of this feature, I will discuss the value currency that a boostrapped startup, or any organization, can leverage to attract and retain talent.\nSome concepts If you are also interested in creating a product or building your startup, check out some of the concepts covered in this piece:\n Minimum viable product and the Business Model Canvas Prototype is something the bare minimum solution to your core problem. Prototyping, or rapid prototyping, is a common term where startups build a barebones version of their product to test whether users find it useful and adopt it. Each new iteration should be data-driven based on feedback from the previous version. Product-market fit refers to a product that satisfies customers demand, which in turn helps sustain a business.

This interview was conducted in Cantonese and translated into English. In Part 1, we covered James’ experiments, learnings, and failures before he arrived at his first hit product, Magic Mirror. In Part 2, James shares how he started working on his product and his early mistakes that taught him how to create revenue in hopes that other fellow developers, UX designers, and entrepreneurs can successfully build their ideas.\nGenerating income in 18 months Back in 2014, James had left Carshare, a growing blog following, but no income. By the time I touched based with him again 18 months later, he had developed a product that generated enough income to be a full-time job. Magic Mirror, (now Magic Sketch) has been featured on Sketch’s official site, Product Hunt, and by many UX industry leaders. With this product, James had achieved his dream of location independent income, flexible work hours, and work-life balance. The day I interviewed him, James was doing the admin work for his first hire.\nJames worked out of the same co-working space between his job as a UX designer and creating Magic Mirror.\nSolve your own problems that help you with your job. So about a year after quitting your job, you had a decent following and a failed product(the book you stopped writing) and a successful product that you couldn’t monetize (the Pomodoro app). How did you apply your learnings to your new product, Magic Mirror? My product, Magic Mirror, helps people fit their Sketch design into stock iPhone or mobile photos. Before, designers had to switch to other tools like Adobe to make the mockups. Since Sketch accepts third party plugins, I learned from other examples people had made and created my first Sketch plugin that could help me synchronise my interface on mobile mockups.\nBasically, the tool I wanted existed in other platforms, which means it has been “validated” already, and probably had a viable market since there were other UX designers like me using Sketch. As a developer, I wanted to solve my own problem and this time, unlike the Pomodoro App, I had a clear potential set of customers.\nHow was this different from your Pomodoro App, where you were also your chief customer? Perhaps the biggest difference is that the Pomodoro technique is a concept and “life hack”. Even if it helps users get more productive in their lives, it does not directly help them with their job and consumers often move on after a while. Magic Mirror helps UI/UX designers do their jobs, saving them lots of time.\nRecognize false positives Was Magic Mirror’s V1 well received? Magic Mirror had a great media coverage and got a lot of traffic from TheNextWeb, Smashing Magazine, and Web Designer Depot, etc. The traffic didn’t help me much because I made a mistake by releasing Magic Mirror for free. I shouldn’t have used the donation model, which was too passive for earning income even with all the referred users. After two months I tried out the freemium model, and it worked much better, but was still quite far from making enough.\nAlso, the media coverage provided a large amount of traffic, but the audience range of audience was wide. I had non-Sketch designers, developers, and the general public, but my product was developed for a niche developer / designer market. In other words, my media conversion rate was very, very low. It was good to try, but I needed a better solution for revenue.\nTrust your amateur gut What did you do to change the product without turning off users who got it for free? I followed my instinct and thought only about designers. Web and mobile designers use Sketch professionally. As a professional, I’m willing to pay for tools that help my work, so I tested my assumption by providing more of what designers wanted. In addition to Magic Mirror, I started selling the templates that I’d made for myself as well. They took me time to do, and would save designers lots of time. Selling the plugin was a good start and selling the templates helped me continue to make revenue. You could say I found two product market fits.\nBe clear on who you are helping to get the right validation Sketch is an indispensable tool for UI/UX designers. These mockups of the productivity iOS app “Today” are provided by James Tang.\nInstead of media publicity, what really validated Magic Mirror was popular designers like Meng To and Peter Nowell using it because they are always looking for the next best tools. As KOLs, their recommendations mattered more for my target users. Another validation that mattered was the Sketch team featuring my plugin in their newsletter, which meant that the company also recognised how it helped its target professionals.\nMagic Mirror is actually one of the early players to monetise successfully while the other Sketch plugins at the time were free to download and use. I still offer a free version and free individual templates because they’re good for converting to paid users. Even though I’m in the startup world and they are often the early adopters for new tools, I had to be clear in mind about who my first priority users were. Bootstrap startups do not make good customers because they would want a free tool for or trial for one-time use. However, Magic Mirror saves professional designers lots of time rendering high-quality mockups and designs for clients; if my users are charging in the $1000s per project, then US$12 for a plug-in is worth the investment.\nCreate added value to grow your revenue Web mockups of Magic Mirror templates. Image courtesy of James Tang\nSince my product is niche, mostly for UI/UX designers, I need to make money off of the ecosystem of content, not just the product itself. Now, I also have tutorials to widen my reach and convert people to the product. For converted users, I have templates.\nBuilding Magic Mirror first began with focusing on building a product professionals would use, which is validation. But there is a difference between validation and product market fit. You can have a “validated” free product, but converting users for paid products is the more challenging product-market fit. My first learning earlier was that for my conversion funnel, driving lots of traffic to the site through publicity wasn’t enough if I wasn’t charging. After users started paying, I had to think about new ways to increase revenue beyond just getting the product out there. I had to think about providing continue added value to users, such as the templates. Plus, I wanted to find ways to attract new users, so I introduced bundles for the plug-in and templates. Finally, I extended to another product, Magic Presenter, to help save users time (again) exporting their mockups to other apps like Google Slides or Keynote.\nAnd, of course, I continued to write blogs and tutorials. My learnings from my blogging practice the year before helped me do effective content marketing for these products. (You can read about James’ blogging experience in Part 1.)\nThe startup work desk as a reflection of character: James’ includes a Spirited Away terrarium.\nAs an active contributor to open-source development and the Hong Kong startup scene, James also wanted to share his last thoughts and words of encouragement:\nLearn publicly. I shared things as I went, and I think people liked that. Since I had an active following and a community of people around me, it provided a stronger audience base for my products as well. You don’t have to share ‘how you got there’ after you’ve finished a successful product. For me, it was also good to just shared my process of building products. People respond more, and it becomes a dialogue. Plus, they gave me ideas and feedback. Even though I developed the products solo, I didn’t feel like I was creating things in a vacuum. I felt like I knew the communities that I was creating for.\nSo, if you really like products, just write first. It’s like a journal that helps you collect best practices. When you’re finally ready to build your product, you already have a lot of relevant experience, such as writing and growth, under your belt.\nBe the shepherd, not the sheep. You can only do so much, don’t sell your time. Most roads will get you to success, because “success” is subjective.\n"});index.add({'id':12,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/docs/asia/helping-hands-yangon/part-2/','title':"Part 2: Recruiting Talent",'section':"Helping Hands Yangon",'content':"How this female founder used trust as a currency when cash isn’t enough in a Myanmar startup Archive Date: February 21, 2018\nThis is Part 2 of an interview with Annie, co-founder of the Myanmar startup and social enterprise Pomelo for Myanmar. She shares how she crossed cultural divides to work with and hire local Burmese artisans, street youth, and single mothers. In Part 1, Annie shared how she developed her product for her first social enterprise, Helping Hands Yangon. Part 2 covers how she grew a business by creating a unique company culture that helped talent acquisition and retention for Burmese locals. Only her given name is used for privacy reasons.\nOverview points:\n Upstream expansion from production to retail “Career development” and opportunities may not be seen that way Poverty can be a barrier to employment Understand employees’ context and priorities is more important than cash Help employees solve basic problems to recruit and retain them Leaders harness trust as a currency   In the sultry heat of Yangon’s afternoon, I walked down windy streets flanked with food stalls, garbage collection carts, and leafy palms. I entered the open gates, spied a carpenter sprawled on top of a table he was working on, passed wirey boys with chocolate skin and oversized t-shirts kicking around a football. More young boys emerged from corners and various parts of the garden, marching purposefully through the lawn. I was meeting with Annie to map out the core value propositions for her two social enterprises using the Business Model Canvas.\nBoys taking a break after school and work — Photo by Athena Lam\nWhat preoccupied Annie when we spoke in 2015 was how to expand impact by growing those businesses while protecting the organizational culture that attracted people in the first place. In addition to the challenges of building those businesses, Annie had huge hurdles finding and keeping local employees despite what seemed like attractive working conditions. Over the course of the afternoon, she explained how Helping Hands Yangon and Pomelo for Myanmar evolved and why she was cautious about business expansion.\nBringing your goods to customers Handmade tote bags at Myanmar startup Helping Hands Yangon — Photo by Athena Lam\nAfter founding Helping Hands (covered in Part 1), Annie and her co-founder established Pomelo, a retail shop that was a natural upstream expansion to retail for the furniture and textile pieces her first social enterprise produced. Pomelo goes beyond being the traditional social enterprise retail shop set up with donor funds to sell artisan handicrafts. The store’s self-financed model means it has to run like a traditional business keeping itself afloat with sales. Sales come when the products are useful or resonate with buyers, and when store staff can effectively engage shoppers. The sales staff are securing their own pay cheques by helping generate revenue and the artisan groups supplying the shop know future orders are dependent on continued production of high quality products. The profits from sales are distributed back to the artisans and staff, creating a direct link between effort and reward, and a feedback loop for trying new products, and customer reception.\nThe decision to open a store was also timely. In 2011, Myanmar began its political reforms to open its economy, which paving the way for investment and tourism. In fact, the economy and tourism exploded. Tourism traffic jumped 29.72% between 2011-12 from 816,369 to 1,058,995. Between 2011 to 2015, inbound tourism had double-digit year-on-year growth to peak at 4,681,020 annual visitors. As a first-mover in retailing local handicrafts, Pomelo was on Google Maps and searches by the time tourists started looking up Myanmar and locals started using smartphones.\nThough having a shop that employed, trained, and “empowered” local staff sounds like a perfect textbook employer, Annie was not flooded with job applications. On the contrary, she had to negotiate with virtually all of her staff, from Helping Hands through to Pomelo. Why?\nGiving employees value that salaries alone cannot buy Colourful colonial houses in downtown Yangon — Photo by Athena Lam\n“Cultural gap” is often the blamed culprit for things not working out between people. What was the cultural gap that made Helping Hands and Pomelo seem attractive to us in theory, but not to local Burmese?\nThe answer is simple: they weren’t interested. Annie proceeded to explain a few cases.\nThere was the single mother who one day said she couldn’t work any more, despite being a great employee at Helping Hands. There were the street youth that she wanted to hire, since they had no money, had dropped out of school, few job prospects, and time to kill. There was the store attendant at Pomelo who was utterly disinterested in book keeping. Each case became a personalized, and lengthy, process of understanding a person’s situation that was a barrier to work, which could have easily spiraled into a vicious unemployment cycle if they were just let go.\nThe employee who was too poor to work One single mother at Helping Hands could not afford to pay rent and raise her five children even with her regular earnings from the company. She had a bigger problem than getting to work on time and didn’t see a way out, so she resigned. Annie only discovered the reason when she asked. Then, in order to keep this valued employee, Annie set out to solve the mother’s problem: finding a home — a free one at that since the employee couldn’t pay, and nor could the company out of fairness to other staff. Eventually, Annie found a vacant (and free!) home through her networks. She gave the mother the key to the apartment under the condition that the mother would leave 2 spare bedrooms for other street youth who were employed in Annie’s businesses and cook for them. Annie not only kept her employee — that mother saved enough money and moved out once she could. She was the first of many cases and the flat became a launchpad for other women just like her who needed a bit of time save up for their independence.\nThe youth who preferred freedom Despite their “depressing” situations to readers with more privileged backgrounds, these individuals have choices too: a choice to not work. For the street youth Annie wanted to hire for Helping Hands, work meant schedules, deadlines, and being ordered around. Even with the part-time pay, hanging out with friends seemed more fun. Even if these young people couldn’t guarantee their next meal or sleeping place, they could at least control how they used their time and where they went. Worse, Annie wanted them to go to school for half the day! Education looks good on paper, but it is a truth universally acknowledged that institutional schooling is reliably boring.\nBut what Annie could offer was a yard where boys could play ball without being chased off the street by shopkeepers and cars. Some young people she pestered and cajoled. Others tagged along after their friends joined. Annie entrusted young people with responsibility, gave second chances, treated them with respect, and eventually won them over. Now, Helping Hands offers daily classes offering literacy, maths, and English, with specialized classes in photography, business skills and swimming. All employees now have access to medical support and flexible working conditions.\nThe staff member who didn’t want to learn higher level skills Finally, there was one promising sales associate at Pomelo that Annie was trying to hand over the store’s book keeping to. As a country that had recently opened up, anyone with a technical skill for office work would increase their employment and career chances. This was the young woman’s career development opportunity by learning transferable skills. In developed countries and international corporations, this would be a shining example of female sponsorship and mentorship.\nBut the young Burmese woman had also grown up in a military dictatorship (which lasted from 1962-2011), with no foreign direct investment or brands, where electricity was a luxury, and blackouts were the norm in Yangon even until 2013. Bookkeeping was not necessary for her or anyone she knew, given that no-one had grown up with much money and there wasn’t much business to manage.\nWhen recounting that latest headache, Annie had sighed with exasperation, but not a drop of resignation. Since then, Pomelo has distilled and strengthened its commitment to “nurturing local talent by providing design and product development training and business mentoring” so that artisans can create high quality products for their customers and sustainable businesses for themselves. Pomelo’s products range from traditional handicrafts and household decorations to practical tableware, kitchenware, and baby clothing.

Like Annie’s employees, they have their own problems to deal with. Before judging someone for not jumping on board, Annie asked questions that helped her decide how act:\n Do I understand and appreciate this person’s priorities? Am I helping solve this person’s immediate problems that helps them do their job? How can I help them meet those needs? What can I do to earn their trust and confidence in me?’  But by giving people a taste of how it felt to be acknowledged, appreciated, and considered, Annie gave people a reason to work with her, especially when money alone was not enough. What bootstrapped organizations lack in funds, they can make up with creativity and compassion. Annie’s company couldn’t pay more, but she could leverage her other resources and networks. Cash-strapped startups often attract talent because they can mine a different type of currency: trust.\nIs trust in one person scalable? Annie’s tailored solutions seem like one-off cases. Apartment keys with no contracts or insurance isn’t practical to roll out as a policy. But can her approach still be extracted to build into the fabric of an organization? Good organizations try.\nTrust building is the philosopher’s stone that makes everything work and everyone happy to keep coming to work. Organizations have tried approaches like Buffer’s radical transparency, Zappo’s paying employees to quit, or flat structures like Gumroad’s. Feelings like trust and happiness are essential to employee productivity and loyalty, and it’s worth experimenting, failing, and trying again to get right.\nBut perhaps the crux of “scalable” trust is not in thinking about replacing people with systems. Instead, it is about considering the elements that makes an organization unique and ensuring those essential strands are woven into the fabric of a growing company through everyone’s conduct.\nWhen I entered and when I finally left at dusk, the people around the estate were not being kept track of.

By 2014, they began collaboratively designing a co-working space with its potential tenants, and launched HEYGROUND in 2017 with over 90% occupancy. The 6000-square metre space has attracted the attention of mainstream media, companies like Patagonia, and South Korea’s sitting President Moon Jae-in. In 2018, we sat down with HKelly Shin from Root Impact to talk about HEYGROUND’s development and ongoing evolution.\n If we’re going to pay for a membership, the least we can do is shop around for the right co-working space. As we walk through a space, we check out the furniture, offices, wall usage, the coffee bar, amenities like a climbing wall or bike racks, maybe the lighting, and definitely the people occupying seats. The specific components of these spaces gives us a reading on the crucial, invisible ingredient to a great workspace — the vibe. HKelly, Root Impact’s Global Partnership Director tell us that visitors at HEYGROUND say that they “can feel some changemaker vibe inside HEYGROUND”. Root Impact is the Korean non-profit behind the 6000-square metre free-standing co-working building dedicated to Changemakers and social entrepreneurs in the heart of Seoul’s Seongsu area. By the time it opened in 2017, it had 99% occupancy.\nHEYGROUND’s departure from other co-working spaces lies somewhere deeper, beyond the building’s foundations first laid in 2016. HEYGROUNDs foundations lie further back, before there was a space to fill, when people working to create positive impact in South Korea might not even have had a term, let alone a space to call their own.\nCo-designing solutions with users HKelly points out, “In South Korea, university graduates are expected to become a civil servant, doctor, a lawyer or work in Samsung, Hyundai, and LG.” People who want to make money off of commercial startups are already taking too big a risk for their parents, let alone social entrepreneurs trying to navigate making a living and making a difference.\nRoot Impact was founded in 2012 as a non-profit that aimed to support what the team calls the “unsung heroes” and Changemakers in South Korea. For the first two years, the Root Impact team focused on providing support through professional services, events, programs for women, and even co-living housing. Eventually, they realised there were deeper issues programming and services alone could not address:\n Financial instability Emotional vulnerability Lack of network and community  Though social enterprises can be for-profit, they are not profit maximising and often targeting niche markets that cannot attract traditional startup funding. As a result, their tight finances means they often cannot sign traditional office leases. In addition, most work in isolation on their specific issues, without access to networks that tech startup founders usually have. The Root Impact team began to ask, “What if we can gather together, work together, support and inspire each other, share knowledge and experience?” Taking it a step further, what if the Root Impact team could “provide a good facility, good space, at a more reasonable price to allow them to focus on their work?”\nHowever, rather than diving straight in to finding a space, the team went back to the Changemaker community, their would-be customers, first. During what HKelly calls the “ground building process”, they invited 24 potential tenants who are CEOs and founders of non-profits and social ventures to monthly discussions for the type of work environment they needed and what type of community they wanted to build together. The Root Impact team took it further and asked what type of services and support these teams needed to grow sustainably.\nAfter the community discussions and 1.5 years of construction, HEYGROUND opened in the summer of 2017 with most of the initial community moved in.\nPrototyping value Image provided by Root ImpactHEYGROUND’s eight-storey building not only reflects the demands of tenants, but the principles that the Root Impact team and the Changemaker community have developed throughout their years of collaboration.\nOn a basic level, HEYGROUND offers the usual co-working space hotdesks, private offices, common spaces and meeting rooms, a cafe and restaurant on the lower floors, and a rooftop event space. In addition, it offers the professional support requested during the design phase, such as access to free legal, accounting, and financial consulting.\nHowever, HEYGROUND’s 500+ members, employed by 70+ non-profits and social ventures are not merely tenants. One of the questions asked during HEYGROUND’s design and planning stages was, “If there is a community, what kind of community do [the members] want to build together?”\nSome of this contribution can be facilitated by HEYGROUND’s approaches to membership. Individual memberships were a minimum of three months and office contracts two years to encourage members to stay longer. In addition, while HEYGROUND members with over 80 people, one understanding is that no company may occupy an entire floor, which cuts off interactions with other community members. This means that when a company grows to 100 people, it should move out, making space for new members to benefit from the ecosystem.\nThough HEYGROUND screens members, it is focused on one specific social issue. It has non-profits such as the Ashoka Foundation and hardware companies like Lineable because, as HKelly puts it, “We wanted to see how members collaborate with each other when they get together.” Members have built websites for each other, pitched in to social media campaigns for each other, and collaborated on projects for specific groups, such as homeless women.\nCollaboration is so central to HEYGROUND’s approach it is baked into the team’s reporting KPIs. In order to continually iterate a conducive, collaborative environment, the 10-person team (at the time of the 2018 interview) has a remit to regularly track members. Standards they have developed within one year of operation include:\n Continued membership Member team’s growth Collaborations between members  The mix of qualitative and quantitative data paints a nuanced picture. For example, over 80% of members are social ventures and their growing team size means that they are likely succeeding in their businesses. Qualitative data includes feedback on services, the facilities, and comparison of HEYGROUND to previous office spaces. Member collaboration is perhaps the metric that is most demonstrative of HEYGROUND’s value, as not only a physical space, but a place that facilitates increased positive impact.\nGrowth through integrity When we interviewed HKelly in late 2018, we immediately asked her about replicating their success model. She responded, “It’s not about opening a lot of spaces. We’re impact-focused and we want to have a high quality of impact.” Fast forward half a year, and HEYGROUND is about to launch a second location, HEYGROUND SEOUL FOREST. This is in response to domestic demand, which in July 2018, had already reached over 700 individuals comprising 229 company applications. Additional locations outside Korea are being explored.\nThe waitlist as a proven market demand is a growth scenario businesses would kill for, but they would have missed the point. HEYGROUND, and its parent Root Impact, had never set out to engineer its own growth. Instead, it has remained laser focused on its mission. HKelly says, “Our top priority is to enhance the quality of the Changemaker community.” She quickly adds, “Compared to startups, I think, it’s harder because the social market is limited…and the global market is more limited.” The true scalability of impact does not end with increasing locations, but decreasing barriers to the spread ideas, products, and solutions. HKelly wonders what can translate across societies, given that many social entrepreneurs are passionate about solving local problems within their communities.\nCo-working beyond a space Image provided by Root ImpactYet, this skepticism and humility can be harnessed as driving forces to continue observing and experimenting. The only way to do that is to have a HEYGROUND presence overseas. Presence does not necessarily mean a space, though that seems an inevitable next step. As the Global Partnerships Director, HKelly travels regularly to build ties with communities abroad, in places like Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taipei, Berlin, and Singapore. But again, global co-working visas are not unique to HEYGROUND. What is unique is how HKelly approaches global ground building. She does this by storytelling, often including companies that are not HEYGROUND members in presentations. “We have a broad definition of community,” she says casually. As long as a company is trying to create a positive impact, she sees them as a member of the Changemaker movement and connects them to resources.\nKey in “social enterprise” on Naver Search, Korea’s Google, and you will find over 600 articles about HEYGROUND. Such a building is not only a landmark accomplishment, but has become a landmark location that gathers emerging startups, opinionated companies like Patagonia, and even dignitaries such as South Korean sitting President Moon Jae-in and the King of Belgium.\nA building is easy to spot. Its physicality anchors people’s mental understanding of Changemaking culture, housing passion, optimism, and business practicality under one roof. But HEYGROUND is not successful because of its beautifully designed space, nor even because there was a proven need. (The businesses, social or otherwise, will always need office space.)\nCo-working spaces, as a subset of real estate, are tough businesses with thin margins. All co-working space operators know that community is the only thing that can keep members and invest heavily in programming to nurture said “community”. As businesses most co-working spaces build a “space” that needs to be filled. The “unique” community they try to foster becomes the product sold to new members. In contrast, HEYGROUND started with the idea of “co-working” and only arrived at “a space” for people to do that more effectively by pooling resources. They succeeded in the alchemy of community building precisely because they remain focused on all the things that “co-working” means: connecting, collaborating, and contributing.\nWhen she arrived in Hong Kong, the first thing she handed me a toothpaste packaged to belong on the shelf beside department store brands. “WithMy isn’t in HEYGROUND, but the founder is a solo founder. She worked as a dentist in the US for years before coming to Korea. This is her line of sustainable, vegan toothpaste that doesn’t use animal testing and good for pregnant women. I just love it.”\nNo matter how celebrated HEYGROUND becomes, it will never be about HEYGROUND, or even the team that runs it. Near the end of our chat, HKelly returns to a point already made, “We exist for our members. Without them, there’s no reason that HEYGROUND exists.” Root Impact built HEYGROUND’s four walls as a safe haven for unreasonable optimists, but ultimately the Changemaker movement is about taking down barriers. Sometimes, the barrier is just that our own mindset is that doing good, creating and sharing good, isn’t the natural way to live a life, and make a living\n"});index.add({'id':14,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/docs/asia/haraldfriedl/','title':"Social Impact Myanmar (SIM)",'section':"Asia",'content':"Preparation in Anticipation for New Markets: Harald Friedl with Social Impact Myanmar (SIM) Archive Date: January 10, 2018\nSocial Impact Mynamar and MVP development approaches to startup hubs, incubators, and ecosystem support in Yangon while waiting for market maturation.\nIt was an unassuming white block for a meeting. It was behind a wall, up a teeny slope, and had a restaurant with a patio beside. When Harald came in, still caught in a phone meeting. He grinned an apologetic greeting, gestured to the menu and nodded a hello at the waitress who came around to take our order. When he was finally let go, he let out an emphatic sigh and instantly switched gears to shake hands. We were meeting to discuss impact investing, startups, and social innovation.\nFrom market surveys to MVP accelerator programs Startup ecosystem mapping in Yangon (2015)\nHarald had written Starting Up in Myanmar: A First Guide in 2014, the first of its kind in a country that was just opening up to foreign investment and still cash-driven. That same year SIM cards sold in the black market for US$900 because the government had just started issuing them and was providing one to each family unit. When I visited in 2015, I could get a pay-as-you-go for US$5. In one year, people had gone from no cell phones to using two in order to maximize coverage using one of the three available networks.\nUsing his journalist and policy advising skills, Harald laid the groundwork for a new startup and innovation ecosystem: consolidating information. Right after giving me the report, which has lead to inquiries from overseas companies, he tells me it’s far from complete. But he had already started thinking about the next step: helping the entrepreneurs that he had interviewed address their struggles. He teamed up with Klaus Oberauer and other business partners to work on a possible product available in other markets: an accelerator or entrepreneurship hub. I had visited during this time to help the team consider their MVP social accelerator options.\nBuilding MVP programs and ecosystems Discussing program possibilities for Social Impact Myanmar on a Yangon rooftop with a view. (2015)\nIn 2015, the Social Impact Mynmar (SIM) team was just forming. The founding members wanted to work with local entrepreneurs and startups on an endless list of potential opportunities the newly opened market could fill. Creating a startup hub could accelerate innovation, but being a first mover before the market had enough infrastructure or critical mass would be ineffective.\nHarald and his co-founders quickly realized the fixed capital investment for a physical hub would provide too much pressure to simply fill seats in a culture where entrepreneurship was not the norm. Though there were bubbling organizations, some of which had been in operation for a few years, there was not enough to sustain a full accelerator program and the overhead costs. Funding from international organizations just beginning to scope out the market would require at least a year of negotiations. They needed a way to increase demand for entrepreneurship support before making a full investment.\nHarald, Klaus, and their partners’ solution was to create Social Impact Myanmar (SIM) as a community of entrepreneurs. The MVP was programming run as workshops and training sessions to give entrepreneurs frameworks for business strategy and a support network. By running programs in venues sponsored by partners, they could offset their main overhead cost and focus on refining their product: workshops. They could also learn more about the needs of the entrepreneurs to inform how they created more cohesive programing in the future. Through these events, they were able to create an active community that supported itself and created buzz (facilitated through Facebook, which is an effective local marketing channel).\nFirst Stake The test for programs is not often how large they are, but how long they last until the market catches up. SIM consistently ran events, whether as workshops or entrepreneurship circles. By 2016, the SIM team had created enough demand for spaces and knowledge resources. In addition, other market infrastructure had emerged to create a critical mass. WiFi and data was readily available, providing opportunities for developers and tech companies to emerge and create viable products for a large enough market of consumers with mobile phones. Foreign companies were entering and international organizations such as development banks and social innovation hubs were actively seeking out local partners.\nHarald and his partners leveraged their international resources and contacts to launch the community space they had envisioned previously. They joined the Impact Hub network and leveraged the international brand to give Impact Hub Yangon a launchpad. Now in 2018, Impact Hub Yangon already has a second location in the central district.\nNow, Harald has moved back to Europe to start The Circle Economy, a social enterprise that aims to accelerate the transition to circularity through solutions that are on the ground, action-focused and scalable.\nDespite his accolades, Harald often biked around Yangon, braving drivers and potholes with equal grace. Three years is light speed for economies, but an eternity for startups. Impact Hub Yangon remains startup that is still consolidating its various income streams. It is reaching out to international partners who want to learn more about the local Myanmar startup and social innovation scenes.\n"});index.add({'id':15,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/docs/tokyo/hub-tokyo/space/','title':"Space as the community’s experiment lab",'section':"Hub Tokyo",'content':"Impact HUB Tokyo: Space as the community’s experiment lab Archive date: June 12, 2018\nAn open, flexible, and multi-functional space “People First, Space Later” has been part of the Impact HUB Tokyo’s guiding philosophy since its inception. Though space comes after, it is nonetheless essential. For this post, we’ll explore how the Impact HUB Tokyo approaches the concept of “Space” below.\nIf you work your way down the slope from Meguro Station, you’ll find an old printing factory hidden in the residential alleys. Without changing the outer walls, Impact HUB Tokyo emerged from the interior renovations, as if it were a secret base or laboratory.\nLike many other Impact Hubs across the globe, Impact HUB Tokyo is located at the intersection of residential and business areas based on the belief that vibrant communities emerge through exchanges between local residents and businesses. In addition, to embody the spirit of an organization that adapts to the changing needs of its community, the Impact HUB Tokyo team decided to renovate the paper factory based on their needs rather than doing straight forward building restoration. With unusual requirements for an office space, the founders chose a printing factory a little ways from Meguro Station that met these requirements. The founders decided on the spot to make it the home of their new community and set to work cleaning and painting the factory with the new Impact HUB Tokyo team.\nImpact HUB Tokyo has a total of 440 square meters (4736 sq ft). When you open a door, you will be welcomed by the scent of drip coffee in an open area with a spacious kitchen, hotdesks, and lounge area.\nOn one of the walls, you’ll find photos of members and the latest event information, and to the left of the kitchen there is an event space that can accommodate up to 200 people.\nBeyond the kitchen area is a workspace. Inside, there are various meeting rooms, spacious open office desks, and private offices.\nAll of this is on the same floor, so it’s easy for members to see what’s going on and discover things that pop up. At the same time, the public and private spaces are separated so that members can also have a quiet space to concentrate on their work.\nDIY persistence and approaches to change At Impact HUB Tokyo, most of the furniture is made in Japan, second hand, or refurbished. Rather than buy expensive furniture and say, “We’re done!” with the setup, the Impact HUB Tokyo team was committed to sourcing ethical furniture and giving pieces a second life.\nThis approach meant that they continued to experiment with DIY furniture that could be easy to use, durable, but also flexible and multifunctional for community use. DIY hacking is a common scene at the space. Since the Impact HUB Tokyo also has a covered parking lot, it has become a DIY hacking space. For example, many ping pong tables were taken apart and made into white boards, which are now essential for daily discussions in meeting rooms.\nThey were also devoted to making their own desks and chairs. In collaboration with a design company, members volunteered to help make desks that were uniquely shaped so that they could be moved and arranged together. The desks were like an ameba. Rather than being a square shape, each side is angled in the hexagon shape, so that there isn’t one “front” side that members need to sit at. Members don’t need to worry about sensitive work material being seen by someone right behind, while on the other hand they can also conveniently start a discussion.\nThe lighting has also been considered. Members can adjust lights to different shades and brightness for their area. With the various types of spaces, members can be comfortable and concentrate on their work in their favorite corner.\nHow space design nurtures impact creation Even though Impact HUB Tokyo has private workspace, once members join, they eventually move out to the co-working area. So far, our observation is that teams who have moved out to the co-working area have been more successful than teams who have stayed in the private workspace.\nOne reason could be that interactions with different people leads to new ideas and collaborations, but even more importantly, members can boost morale in their exchanges with others.\nOur founders joke that the kitchen area is a hub in the Hub. Members are always gathered around the coffee maker, having random chats with a coffee mug in hand. Just a casual “Coffee’s ready. How about a coffee together?” quickly becomes an intense discussion. Other people who pass by quickly join in and very soon, there’s a full-on meeting in the lounge. That’s a common occurrence. The collaboration at Impact HUB Tokyo happens not in a meeting room, but the open spaces.\nThe Impact HUB Tokyo’s location and coworking space design was a departure from the typical office spaces available at the time. This design served the Impact HUB’s main thesis that effective impact happens through collaboration.\nRevolutions begin in coffeehouses** The reason Impact HUB Tokyo is committed to creating the right space is because it’s not meant to be just a coworking space for work, but rather a place where positive impact initiatives are born and nurtured.\nIn his TEDTalk “Where good ideas come from“, American writer Steven Johnson said, “People think that important breakthrough ideas happen by deliberating deeply alone (‘People often credit their ideas to individual “Eureka!” moments’), but actually new ideas happen in places where people from different backgrounds get together to discuss ideas.”\nHe says that the industrial revolution in England did not succeed without a coffeehouse. “It was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds, different fields of expertise, and share. This is the kind of chaotic environment where ideas were likely to come together, where people were likely to have new, interesting, unpredictable collisions — people from different backgrounds.” He describes this network that produces innovation as a “liquid network”.\nIf there is a space where diverse people exchange ideas, could there be a continuous flow of new collaborations? From observing how people gather as a community, not everyone joins the same discussion. First, ideas usually take seed from deep discussions we have with a small group of people we’re close to. These ideas get refined as they are taken from place to place and further discussed with new people. It is from collecting these scattered responses that an idea actually emerges into a plan. In order for these many ideas to be actioned by a community, there has to be a “node” to channel people’s passion and create momentum.\nThe Impact HUB Tokyo takes inspiration from observing its community and experiments with tangible and intangible inputs so that the space can help maximize the outcome of each members’ projects. By doing this day after day, we accumulate “know-how” and can continue to accelerate our speed of innovation by learning from community experience.\n This piece is a translation from Impact HUB Tokyo’s original post “Impact HUB Hosts’ Story Vol.1 : 空間は、コミュニティの実験のためのラボ” with permission.\nWriter/Editor: Ishikawa Koumei (石川孔明) Translator: Yuki Fujimoto\n"});index.add({'id':16,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/docs/tokyo/hub-tokyo/hosting-team/','title':"The hosting team and members",'section':"Hub Tokyo",'content':"The hosting team and members A facilitator of a community “Hosting team” Impact HUB Tokyo is a co-working place where Impact Makers get together. Various initiatives are created in order to facilitate collaboration between members. In Part 1, we covered how the design of the space, facilities, and furniture can support innovation. However, no matter how amazing the space is or how many strangers are gathered together…that alone isn’t enough for innovation. In order to new approaches, the “software” needs to be added to the existing “hardware”. In other words, there has to be a system that helps foster relationships between members to become a networked community. For this post, we will introduce the Impact HUB Tokyo’s “hosting team” that curates, supports, and nurtures this community ecosystem.\nThe Impact HUB Tokyo’s hosting team acts as a community facilitator. This role has multiple facets, but it could be divided roughly into two types. The first one is the role as the administrator to ensure that members using the co-working space can work comfortably. A host is crucial to help minimize distractions for members who want to focus. For example, the responsibilities can range from booking meeting rooms, to explaining how to use facilities and trouble shooting equipment for members. A host is there to help address issues so that members don’t have to break the flow of their work.\nCommunity is bound by “why” not “what” Another key role for the hosting team is facilitation to proactively nurture an active community. Communities can exist without a host, but a host can help identify appropriate initiatives, foster positive energy, and inspire the community with new ideas. One of the hosts who specializes in cross-cultural communication, Misaki Iwai, describes the role as follows:\n“A host is like catalyst for the Impact HUB Tokyo community. We support new members so that they can be get used to the environment easily. Our role is to bring the right mix of people together, the way chemists invent new compounds. Through our daily interactions with members, we know their priorities and challenges and connect them to the relevant Hub members at the right time. If members have the same challenge, we may create events or offer a team learning session.”\nWhile doing these things, they have also observed how the community responds and realised that there is one more essential condition to produce innovation. The members in the community are bound together not by the what, but by the why.\n“When people first get to know each other, what do they do? What position do they hold at work? What is their appearance like? In other words, we tend to focus on the “what”. Of course, collaboration can happen based on the “what”, but in order to go deeper, and have collaboration become innovation — for this challenge, my opinion is — And I really like this — people need to be brought together with a shared *why *[purpose].”\nCollaboration can happen even at the what level. For example, if a company wanted to improve their design, they would ask a designer, “What am I missing, or what can I do?” in case of a company who wants to enhance their design, if they agree with the approaches proposed, then they can collaborate to improve the product. Once you’ve started collaborating, in order to create deeper and large-scale changes over time, there needs to be a process of continuous innovation.\nOn the other hand, the discontinuous quantum leap process* is complex and cannot be approached in a straight forward manner. Members who still have many uncertainties, but have issues they cannot stop thinking about may talk to other members about their ideas bit by bit to refine their ideas. The people who end up working together are connected not for utilitarian purposes, but rather by a shared sense of passion, and are able to collaborate and produce results that they couldn’t have imagined alone.\nThe hosting team understand the importance of process for innovation and takes time every day to have casual conversations with members to get a sense of their personal “why”. When they see commonalities, they connect people who seem unrelated on paper. Misaki describes the process as an iceberg.’What we can see is just the top of iceberg, and we can’t see bigger parts under water. A host’s most critical skill is the ability to see under water and connect the members at the right time.’ The hosting team at Impact HUB Tokyo is supporting community beneath the surface.\n This piece is a translation from Impact HUB Tokyo’s original post “Impact HUB Hosts’ STORY Vol.2 HUBのメンバーシップとホスティングチーム（前編)” with permission.\nWriter/Editor: Ishikawa Koumei (石川孔明) Translator: Yuki Fujimoto\n"});index.add({'id':17,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/docs/tokyo/hub-tokyo/entrepreneurship-thoughts/','title':"Thoughts on entrepreneurship and climbing",'section':"Hub Tokyo",'content':"Thoughts on entrepreneurship and climbing Archive date: May 10, 2018\nEditorial Note: The original Japanese word “登山” is a general term that means going up a mountain and can refer to hiking, trekking, climbing, and mountaineering. In this piece, the author is usually referring to hiking, but the translation team has made some editorial decisions based on cultural context.\nMany moments, I find myself reflecting on the similarities between climbing and entrepreneurship. It began with my love of nature which got me into climbing and trail running. For example, Impact HUB Tokyo is like a mountain hut, where climbers can rest, take shelter, and get the latest information. Let’s start with some other common parallels to reflect on the startup life through the experience of climbing.\nOthers say it’s crazy. But is it really? The words “climbing” and “entrepreneurship” seem to elicit the same reactions in people. Of course, I’m referring mostly about people who aren’t interested in climbing or entrepreneurship. Both topics usually elicit words like “hard” or “challenging”. From an ordinary person’s perspective, the mountain is a place that brings about exhaustion, the heat, then the cold, too many bugs, and even the bears. But for people who actually climb, the “difficult” parts don’t make up that much of the experience. Proper preparations can also be made to deal with dangerous situations.\nIt can perhaps be said that people climb for the experience and sense of achievement that comes from overcoming hardships. For mountain lovers, the lack of electricity, the burden of carrying water and other essentials — the sum of all the modern-day inconveniences is precisely the charm.\nEven though people refer to “climbing” as if there was only one way up a mountain, there are actually many ways to do it. There are those who seek out the tallest and most difficult mountains, or those who pride themselves on hitting all of Japan’s 100 Famous Peaks, or those who enjoy a relaxing hike appreciating the alpine flora. Perhaps it is because climbing can have something for everyone that it has become so popular. Some people do not even care about making the summit. Trail runs are also faster compared to hiking, giving a different experience to the same mountain. The physical challenges are also quite different. Either way, it’s possible to meet great friends/comrades through the various ways one spends time on a mountain. This sense of camaraderie is probably also what supports lonely entrepreneurs and career-driven people in their 30s and 40s.\nThe simplicity and force of “Because I like it” Entrepreneurs like their jobs and climbers like their climbing. Despite something being “hard”, you do it because you like it. And because you like it, you can keep going; what’s more, you’ll push yourself to go even further.\nThe thing is, with hiking, your route is complete once you’ve gone up and down the mountain. But for entrepreneurship, it feels like there’s never an end in sight. In that respect, climbing guarantees a sense of fulfilment once you’ve finished your route. Also, you can plan for climbing. You can estimate the duration of a route, prepare for hazards or high altitudes, and turn back when the weather is bad or your body can’t go on. You can mitigate risks, plan to arrive at a rest hut before sunset, and make sure there is ample time planned in your schedule. Climbing has many different tried and true methods. Because on the mountain, what you do is, in essence, a matter of life and death.\nIt could be said that deep down, both entrepreneurship and trekking is like putting your life at stake. Except entrepreneurship isn’t about survival so much as it is about the scale of effect this choice has on your way of life.\nTo lose not to adversity and keep going onward. There is a famous commencement speech that the late Steve Jobs gave. In his first story, he talked about connecting the dots. These “dots” can be all the moments in all the days that eventually lead you towards a summit. But for Jobs, “you can’t connect the dots looking forward… you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future” by finding and doing what you love. In Jobs’ words, “The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle.” If those of us who seek, be it entrepreneurs or climbers, don’t stop searching until we have found our calling. If we can abandon “common sense” and find what we love, then maybe we can approach that state of “staying hungry and foolish” that Jobs speaks of.\nThis time, I drew parallels between climbing and entrepreneurship based on my own experiences on mountain trails, but there will certainly be those who say, “That’s not true” or “It’s not like that”. If I have the opportunity, next time I would like to hear the unique experiences and perspectives from my fellow Hubbers.\n Up until the point of writing, I have climbed Mount Fuji, Mount Kita, Mount Kitahotaka, Mount Tsubakuro, Mount Jonen to Mount Aino, Mount Haku, and Mount Takao. My first trail running competition was the Three Peaks Race, a 23km short course. In 2016, I completed the 100km Mount Haku geo-trail in 3 days. I’m considering entering the 7-day 250km challenge next year.\nIn general, I like travelling and “playing”. If nature and yummy food are added too, my life is complete! I am currently seeking out a style of work that has flexible hours and is location-independent through trial and error. I’m also learning from the entrepreneurial spirit at Impact HUB Tokyo.\n This piece is a translation from Impact HUB Tokyo’s original post “Vol. 2 登山と起業は似てる Members’ Story” with permission.\nWriter/Editor: Ryoko Okamoto (岡村亮子) Translator: Michelle Lai\n"});index.add({'id':18,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/docs/tokyo/hub-tokyo/impact-maker/','title':"What is an Impact Maker?",'section':"Hub Tokyo",'content':"What is an Impact Maker? Archive: March 26, 2018\nQuestioning + Action = Impact In February 2013, Impact HUB Tokyo had begun renovations a former print factory’s ground floor. After surviving for two years, co-founders Shino and Shingo, painted the words “Questioning + Action = Impact” on the building’s white wall. The words embody the ethos of the company: it is only though questioning the status quo that we can begin to take action. From this, the actions create the programs and organisations that make a positive impact on society. They were convinced that this equation reflected the shared values of the people from all walks of life who gathered at Impact HUB Tokyo.\nSince then, Impact HUB Tokyo has grown into a thriving community of 400 entrepreneurs (since June, 2017). When one hears the word “entrepreneur”, the image of a company or NGO founder probably comes to mind. But originally, the word entrepreneur referred to a person who questions the current situation and takes action”. The Impact HUB Tokyo has fostered the community of people they called Impact Makers.\nImpact Makers are not restricted to an industry or position. They are not only founders, but also freelancers, artists, or business people working for corporations or government officers. Anyone can be an Impact Maker. Their common point is their approach as people who are critical of how things are right now and taking action to contribute to a better future.\nImpact that can change the course of a river Why is the Impact HUB Tokyo focused on impact? The seeds of this mission were sown before the two founders founded the organization, which itself is a social enterprise. One of the founders, Shino previously worked for international NGOs and a think tank, and also did social and environmentally responsible investments (impact investment) in developing countries and EU, and business development and R\u0026amp;D projects in foreign countries. She first learned about the Impact HUB during her time in the UK. The first Impact HUB opened its doors in Islington, in the North of London and has since spread globally, attracting entrepreneurs working to create positive impacts in their respective regions and communities.\nShino visited various Impact HUBs and noted their distinct characters. For example, the first Impact HUB in Islington had many social entrepreneurs and environmental activists. At the Impact HUB SF, there were venture capitalists who made investments in startups successively. Shino spent much of her time at Impact HUB Westminster in Central London. There, she found not only entrepreneurs, but also hackers, engineers, designers, who worked on new collaborations every day.\nShino was thinking it was not only the people engaged in poverty and education that could throw controversy to society. Entrepreneurs pioneering robotics and artists revealing the world’s hypocracies can also change society. Shino felt that Japan also needed an open place to house an entrepreneurial community and attract like-minded people to build connections. So, when she returned to Tokyo, she founded the Impact HUB Tokyo.\nImpact HUB Tokyo does not believe that impact is created by the lone hero. If one were to imagine how a river flows, the course of a river is changed by the complex interactions it has with the natural environment. Societal norms can also shift as the result of an accumulation of bold actions. As individuals who make up society, it is within our power to to create a big wave (critical mass) of questioning that triggers a change in direction. We can persist in working on disruptive impact until the course of the river changes. This scene plays out every day at the Impact HUB Tokyo makes, and is the enabling environment Shino had envisioned.\nWorld-Class entrepreneurship, Japanese style The Impact HUB Tokyo’s other founder, Shingo Potier, brings another set of experiences. Shingo previously worked at a financial institution in London and worked with local start-ups. Shingo had the opportunity to support a Japanese startup and discovered the lack of support for entrepreneurs in the country. He found that while there were passionate entrepreneurs, there were few visionary “game changers” who could disrupt existing industries. He found Japanese entrepreneurs to prefer safe harmony that fitted into existing norms rather than innovation, too complacent for him.\nAccording to Shingo, “This is not just an issue of entrepreneurial quality”. He has seen the scenario again and again, where the visions and passions of entrepreneurs are twisted and taken apart by intermediaries who were risk-adverse and preferred short-term returns. The VCs and financial institutions that were meant to support entrepreneurs were the ones that created the barriers and undynamic environment. In contrast to the UK government actively fostering entrepreneurial education, the Japanese government did not understand the needs of entrepreneurs or how to develop competitive global businesses.\nUnsurprisingly, when compared to the UK, the support for entrepreneurship in Japan was not good. Though Shingo was disheartened, he reset his approach to “Forget what doesn’t exist, and focus on what does.” He felt there had to be a Japanese-style of entrepreneurship that could be world-class. In order to create that, there needed to be a new approach to educating entrepreneurs on how to make an impact on the existing system.\nAround that time, he met Impact HUB Tokyo. He joined as a financial specialist, helped structure management and he started two programs: “Team 360” to share his startup knowledge with new entrepreneurs and the pitch event “Spark Plug”.\nBe the change Both founders agree that for an Impact Maker a change is neither a trend to follow, nor even an attempt to change another person.” Rather, in the words of Gandhi,“Be the change that you wish to see in the world.” The only thing we can reliably do is change ourselves and embody the change that we wish to see in the world.\nJust like the Impact Makers who come every day, the Impact HUB Tokyo is constantly growing. The activities, ways of connecting, and space layout are constantly evolving. The only thing that remains unchanged for the Impact HUB Tokyo community is the constant process of change itself.\n This piece is a translation from Impact HUB Tokyo’s original post “Founders’ Story Vol. 1 Impact MAKERとは？” with permission.\nWriter/Editor: Ishikawa Koumei (石川孔明) Translator: Yuki Fujimoto\n"});index.add({'id':19,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/docs/tokyo/hub-tokyo/basecamp/','title':"What’s a basecamp?",'section':"Hub Tokyo",'content':"What\u0026rsquo;s a basecamp? Archive date: April 2, 2018\nThe Basecamp for Extreme Climbers What differentiates the Impact HUB Tokyo other investor and VC-backed co-working spaces and incubators? The founders, Shino and Shingo, describe their role as a basecamp for alpine climbers. The Impact Makers who question the status quo and take action to create the change they want to see in the world are like the climbers who scale the summits to see the glorious panoramas below. Like these alpine basecamps, Impact Makers also need their basecamp to summit a mountain no-one else has yet charted.\nWhat basecamp essentials are needed to serve an Impact Maker? The most important component is whatever helps them maximize their effectiveness (output). To facilitate this, workspaces are designed to attract and foster quality. Such a space is designed to support entrepreneurial productivity, but also help these changemakers relax. For that reason, a lounge, kitchen space, cafe, and other facilities play an important role to restore their energy for the long-haul.\nTangible and intangible inputs for high-quality output Maintaining high quality performance can only happen with equally high quality inputs. Even the most resolved Impact Maker will encounter huge setbacks with a half-baked roadmap or inadequate equipment and know-how. For this reason, the Impact HUB Tokyo’s founders initially focused on support programs for startups. Even after running for several years, the Impact HUB Tokyo continues to research startup trends in Japan and globally to update and introduce new accelerator programs in Tokyo and in Japan.\nAlso, quality learning is made possible through frequent community experience and knowledge sharing. That point is a crucial part of Impact HUB Tokyo’s ethos. Support for startups does not end at investment and business plan advisory. For example, entrepreneurs also need help on practical issues like issuing credit cards after business setup, or back office needs like accounting, secretarial work and drafting contracts.\nIn practice, the Impact HUB Tokyo facilitates sharing for general and specific experiences, ideas as well as professional tips on a daily basis. Sometimes, it’s a casual chat in the lounge space, but the organisation also hosts a variety of events. The events are not only the official events hosted by Impact HUB Tokyo staff, but also casual events that members initiate. This atmosphere demonstrates the Impact HUB Tokyo’s grassroots, organic community growth.\nThe Common core in Impact HUB Tokyo’s programs That sums up the various aspects of the organic design behind our programs that make this space a basecamp for Impact Makers. Next, we will introduce the Impact HUB Tokyo’s highlight programs.\nImpact HUB Tokyo offers eight programs in two categories (as of June, 2017). The two categories are “Laboratory Programmes”, which are available only to members and intensive “Accelerator Programmes” that are open to the public. Below, we share the key concepts that underly all the programs.\nTeam learning The programs that Impact HUB Tokyo develop challenge traditional processes and the status quo. Many existing startup programs use the traditional schooling methods where concepts like marketing and business plans are taught by a “teacher”. In truth, for a generation of entrepreneurs trying to create change by using the latest technologies and approaches like crowdfunding do not find these traditional methods that relevant. In addition, there are programs where famous startup founders give advice to new entrepreneurs. However, these talks only temporarily inspire people and don’t have a long-lasting effect and some advice can even confuse entrepreneurs who are just starting out.\nInstead, Impact HUB Tokyo’s founders focused on “continuous team learning”. Rather than relying on the snippets of advice successful startup founders impart from the stage, the Impact HUB Tokyo is convinced that a steady process of growing in the trenches together will have a more effective impact for entrepreneurs in Japan. Therefore, the focus lies in fostering relationships between members, not through competion, but rather encouraging mutual support. The relationships that are created in the community will carry members forward even after they have moved on.\nCreating businesses that deliver a core value Entrepreneurs are often focus on “revenue” and “selling” when planning or just after startup. In addition, they often want to secure immediate returns or investment and forget about the core value proposition that their business should be delivering. Such businesses may be initially successful, but eventually, such founders will ask themselves, “Why am I doing this?” and “Why does this product or service even need to exist?”. Then, the business’ core falls apart. Unfortunately, the reality is that many startups fail. The Impact HUB Tokyo delivers programs so that entrepreneurs can find a strong mission and value proposition (core) so that entrepreneurs can build businesses that are aligned to their goals as they grow.\nFinally, the Impact HUB Tokyo pays a crucial role in supporting Impact Makers and entrepreneurs. Even the most strong-willed and determined Impact Maker must learn to embrace the fear that comes with founding a business. To overcome this and their subconscious self-limitations, these entrepreneurs need someone to be beside them. Their partner needs to also be an Impact Maker who understand how it feels, and the Impact HUB Tokyo as a startup itself meets this requirement.\nPersistence makes perfect After the programs began, the results from “learning as a team” have been remarkable. Some program graduates had “refills” (okawari) of this approach by forming their own groups. One year later, the growth has been overwhelming, with the startups experiencing a remarkable growth, demonstrating the effectiveness of the continued peer pressure from a team.\nFor this reason, Impact HUB Tokyo also places an emphasis on post-program support. Programs with a fixed duration usually only focus on the business plan, but unfinished work and next steps remain unsupported. The Impact HUB Tokyo offers successive follow-up with entrepreneurs, a system for tracking progress, and positive peer pressure. These follow-up components help more graduates succeed in the long-term, which also improves the program’s overall success rate.\nNot just a co-working space As a basecamp for the arduous climb that is entrepreneurship, the Impact HUB Tokyo helps these courageous climbers create innovative solutions by providing the tangible and intangible support to help them rest and recharge — though it’s a lot of work, this comprehensive design is a solid foundation. In order to amplify the impact of the people who gather here, the Impact HUB Tokyo creates both hard and soft supports in its community and space design.\n This piece is a translation from Impact HUB Tokyo’s original post “Founders’ Story: Vol. 2 Basecampとは？” with permission.\nWriter/Editor: Ishikawa Koumei (石川孔明) Translator: Yuki Fujimoto\n"});index.add({'id':20,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/posts/creating-a-new-theme/','title':"Creating a New Theme",'section':"Blog",'content':"Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won\u0026rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.\nIn this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the \u0026ldquo;$\u0026rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with \u0026ldquo;#\u0026rdquo; are comments that I\u0026rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the \u0026ldquo;:wq\u0026rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n## this is a comment $ echo this is a command this is a command ## edit the file $ vi foo.md +++ date = \u0026quot;2014-09-28\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;creating a new theme\u0026quot; +++ bah and humbug :wq ## show it $ cat foo.md +++ date = \u0026quot;2014-09-28\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;creating a new theme\u0026quot; +++ bah and humbug $ Some Definitions There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.\nSkins Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.\nYou have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts/ directory so it will always find the skin.\nYour second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?\nThe difference between creating a skin in layouts/ and creating it in themes/ is very subtle. A skin in layouts/ can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in themes/, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.\nThe rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the themes/ directory a theme.\nNote that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the layouts/ directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.\nThe Home Page The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public/ directory, our home page is public/index.html.\nSite Configuration File When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.\nHugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your content/ directory and template files in your themes/ directory. It will create HTML files in your public/ directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.\nContent Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.\nFront Matter The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “+++”, YAML by “---”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.\nThe information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.\nMarkdown Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.\nTemplate Files Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it\u0026rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.\nThere are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.\nHugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.\nPlease note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.\nSingle Template A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.\nList Template A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.\nThe homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.\nPartial Template A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.\nCreate a New Site Let\u0026rsquo;s use Hugo to create a new web site. I\u0026rsquo;m a Mac user, so I\u0026rsquo;ll create mine in my home directory, in the Sites folder. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Linux, you might have to create the folder first.\nThe \u0026ldquo;new site\u0026rdquo; command will create a skeleton of a site. It will give you the basic directory structure and a useable configuration file.\n$ hugo new site ~/Sites/zafta $ cd ~/Sites/zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 16:49 . drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 16:49 .. drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ Take a look in the content/ directory to confirm that it is empty.\nThe other directories (archetypes/, layouts/, and static/) are used when customizing a theme. That\u0026rsquo;s a topic for a different tutorial, so please ignore them for now.\nGenerate the HTML For the New Site Running the hugo command with no options will read all the available content and generate the HTML files. It will also copy all static files (that\u0026rsquo;s everything that\u0026rsquo;s not content). Since we have an empty site, it won\u0026rsquo;t do much, but it will do it very quickly.\n$ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms $ The \u0026ldquo;--verbose\u0026rdquo; flag gives extra information that will be helpful when we build the template. Every line of the output that starts with \u0026ldquo;INFO:\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;WARN:\u0026rdquo; is present because we used that flag. The lines that start with \u0026ldquo;WARN:\u0026rdquo; are warning messages. We\u0026rsquo;ll go over them later.\nWe can verify that the command worked by looking at the directory again.\n$ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ See that new public/ directory? Hugo placed all generated content there. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to publish your web site, that\u0026rsquo;s the place to start. For now, though, let\u0026rsquo;s just confirm that we have what we\u0026rsquo;d expect from a site with no content.\n$ ls -l public total 16 -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 416 Sep 29 17:02 index.xml -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 262 Sep 29 17:02 sitemap.xml $ Hugo created two XML files, which is standard, but there are no HTML files.\nTest the New Site Verify that you can run the built-in web server. It will dramatically shorten your development cycle if you do. Start it by running the \u0026ldquo;server\u0026rdquo; command. If it is successful, you will see output similar to the following:\n$ hugo server --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms Serving pages from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313 Press Ctrl+C to stop Connect to the listed URL (it\u0026rsquo;s on the line that starts with \u0026ldquo;Web Server\u0026rdquo;). If everything is working correctly, you should get a page that shows the following:\nindex.xml sitemap.xml That\u0026rsquo;s a listing of your public/ directory. Hugo didn\u0026rsquo;t create a home page because our site has no content. When there\u0026rsquo;s no index.html file in a directory, the server lists the files in the directory, which is what you should see in your browser.\nLet’s go back and look at those warnings again.\nWARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] That second warning is easier to explain. We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.\nNow for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.\nI like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it\u0026rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default/list.html, and _default/single.html. There are some rules that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a template for the home page and it told you so.\nAt this point, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon. All that’s left is to add some content and a theme to display it.\nCreate a New Theme Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a few available (I counted a dozen when I first installed Hugo) and Hugo comes with a command to create new themes.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to create a new theme called \u0026ldquo;zafta.\u0026rdquo; Since the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to fill out the files to pull in your content, the theme will not contain any CSS. In other words, ugly but functional.\nAll themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.\nCreate a Skeleton Use the hugo \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme. This creates the directory structure and places empty files for you to fill out.\n$ hugo new theme zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes $ find themes -type f | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 1081 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/LICENSE.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/archetypes/default.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/list.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials/footer.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials/header.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 93 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/theme.toml $ The skeleton includes templates (the files ending in .html), license file, a description of your theme (the theme.toml file), and an empty archetype.\nPlease take a minute to fill out the theme.toml and LICENSE.md files.

This is the file public/index.html. Hugo created a css/ directory. Hugo created a js/ directory. Hugo claimed that it created 0 pages. It created a file and copied over static files, but didn\u0026rsquo;t create any pages. That\u0026rsquo;s because it considers a \u0026ldquo;page\u0026rdquo; to be a file created directly from a content file. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t count things like the index.html files that it creates automatically.  The Home Page Hugo supports many different types of templates. The home page is special because it gets its own type of template and its own template file. The file, layouts/index.html, is used to generate the HTML for the home page. The Hugo documentation says that this is the only required template, but that depends. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s warning message shows that it looks for three different templates:\nWARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] If it can\u0026rsquo;t find any of these, it completely skips creating the home page. We noticed that when we built the site without having a theme installed.\nWhen Hugo created our theme, it created an empty home page template. Now, when we build the site, Hugo finds the template and uses it to generate the HTML for the home page. Since the template file is empty, the HTML file is empty, too. If the template had any rules in it, then Hugo would have used them to generate the home page.\n$ find . -name index.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 20:21 ./public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 ./themes/zafta/layouts/index.html $ The Magic of Static Hugo does two things when generating the site. It uses templates to transform content into HTML and it copies static files into the site. Unlike content, static files are not transformed. They are copied exactly as they are.\nHugo assumes that your site will use both CSS and JavaScript, so it creates directories in your theme to hold them. Remember opinions? Well, Hugo\u0026rsquo;s opinion is that you\u0026rsquo;ll store your CSS in a directory named css/ and your JavaScript in a directory named js/. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like that, you can change the directory names in your theme directory or even delete them completely. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s nice enough to offer its opinion, then behave nicely if you disagree.\n$ find themes/zafta -type d | xargs ls -ld drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 17:38 themes/zafta drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/archetypes drwxr-xr-x 5 quoha staff 170 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static/css drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static/js $ The Theme Development Cycle When you\u0026rsquo;re working on a theme, you will make changes in the theme\u0026rsquo;s directory, rebuild the site, and check your changes in the browser. Hugo makes this very easy:\n Purge the public/ directory. Run the built in web server in watch mode. Open your site in a browser. Update the theme. Glance at your browser window to see changes. Return to step 4.  I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.\nCheck the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.\nPurge the public/ Directory When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the public/ directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this. Churning on a SSD can be costly.\nHugo\u0026rsquo;s Watch Option Hugo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;--watch\u0026rdquo; option will monitor the content/ and your theme directories for changes and rebuild the site automatically.\nLive Reload Hugo\u0026rsquo;s built in web server supports live reload. As pages are saved on the server, the browser is told to refresh the page. Usually, this happens faster than you can say, \u0026ldquo;Wow, that\u0026rsquo;s totally amazing.\u0026rdquo;\nDevelopment Commands Use the following commands as the basis for your workflow.\n## purge old files. hugo will recreate the public directory. ## $ rm -rf public ## ## run hugo in watch mode ## $ hugo server --watch --verbose Here\u0026rsquo;s sample output showing Hugo detecting a change to the template for the home page. Once generated, the web browser automatically reloaded the page. I\u0026rsquo;ve said this before, it\u0026rsquo;s amazing.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo server --watch --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms Watching for changes in /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/content Serving pages from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313 Press Ctrl+C to stop INFO: 2014/09/29 File System Event: [\u0026quot;/Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/layouts/index.html\u0026quot;: MODIFY|ATTRIB] Change detected, rebuilding site WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 1 ms Update the Home Page Template The home page is one of a few special pages that Hugo creates automatically. As mentioned earlier, it looks for one of three files in the theme\u0026rsquo;s layout/ directory:\n index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html  We could update one of the default templates, but a good design decision is to update the most specific template available. That\u0026rsquo;s not a hard and fast rule (in fact, we\u0026rsquo;ll break it a few times in this tutorial), but it is a good generalization.\nMake a Static Home Page Right now, that page is empty because we don\u0026rsquo;t have any content and we don\u0026rsquo;t have any logic in the template.

The homepage doesn\u0026rsquo;t show the new content, either. We have to update the templates to add the posts.\nList and Single Templates In Hugo, we have three major kinds of templates. There\u0026rsquo;s the home page template that we updated previously. It is used only by the home page. We also have \u0026ldquo;single\u0026rdquo; templates which are used to generate output for a single content file. We also have \u0026ldquo;list\u0026rdquo; templates that are used to group multiple pieces of content before generating output.\nGenerally speaking, list templates are named \u0026ldquo;list.html\u0026rdquo; and single templates are named \u0026ldquo;single.html.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are three other types of templates: partials, content views, and terms. We will not go into much detail on these.\nAdd Content to the Homepage The home page will contain a list of posts. Let\u0026rsquo;s update its template to add the posts that we just created. The logic in the template will run every time we build the site.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Hugo uses the Go template engine. That engine scans the template files for commands which are enclosed between \u0026ldquo;{{\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;}}\u0026quot;. In our template, the commands are:\n range .Title end  The \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; command is an iterator. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use it to go through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.\nThe \u0026ldquo;.Title\u0026rdquo; command prints the value of the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.\nThe \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds \u0026ldquo;end.\u0026rdquo; Everything between the \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.\nBuild the web site and then verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026quot;tag\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;category\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;categories\u0026quot;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name '*.html' | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:23 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts. The posts themselves are still empty, but let\u0026rsquo;s take a moment to appreciate what we\u0026rsquo;ve done. Your template now generates output dynamically. Believe it or not, by inserting the range command inside of those curly braces, you\u0026rsquo;ve learned everything you need to know to build a theme. All that\u0026rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.\nAnd, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, though, that\u0026rsquo;s all to come.\nAdd Content to the Posts We\u0026rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content/post/ directory. That means that their section is \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; (and if we don\u0026rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo;).\nHugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can\u0026rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default/ directory. There are some twists that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post/single.html, then _default/single.html.\nNow that we know the search rule, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we actually have available:\n$ find themes/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 132 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html We could create a new template, post/single.html, or change the default. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t know of any other content types, let\u0026rsquo;s start with updating the default.\nRemember, any content that we haven\u0026rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we\u0026rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve made. It\u0026rsquo;s good because we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It\u0026rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we\u0026rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we\u0026rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.\nPlease see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you\u0026rsquo;re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page. That\u0026rsquo;s a refreshing amount of joy right there.\nUpdate the Template File $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Build the web site and verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026quot;tag\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;category\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;categories\u0026quot;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name '*.html' | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:40 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 125 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 128 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/post/first/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my first post\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ cat public/post/second/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my second post\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Notice that the posts now have content.

Hugo lets \u0026ldquo;slug\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;URL\u0026rdquo; override the permalinks setting in the configuration file. Go ahead and comment out the slug in content/about.md, then generate the web site to get it to be created in the right place.\nSharing Templates If you\u0026rsquo;ve been following along, you probably noticed that posts have titles in the browser and the home page doesn\u0026rsquo;t. That\u0026rsquo;s because we didn\u0026rsquo;t put the title in the home page\u0026rsquo;s template (layouts/index.html). That\u0026rsquo;s an easy thing to do, but let\u0026rsquo;s look at a different option.\nWe can put the common bits into a shared template that\u0026rsquo;s stored in the themes/zafta/layouts/partials/ directory.\nCreate the Header and Footer Partials In Hugo, a partial is a sugar-coated template. Normally a template reference has a path specified. Partials are different. Hugo searches for them along a TODO defined search path. This makes it easier for end-users to override the theme\u0026rsquo;s presentation.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/partials/header.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; :wq $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/partials/footer.html \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq Update the Home Page Template to Use the Partials The most noticeable difference between a template call and a partials call is the lack of path:\n{{ template \u0026quot;theme/partials/header.html\u0026quot; . }} versus\n{{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} Both pass in the context.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s change the home page template to use these new partials.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} {{ if eq .Type \u0026quot;post\u0026quot;}} \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ end }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;pages\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ range .Data.Pages }} {{ if or (eq .Type \u0026quot;page\u0026quot;) (eq .Type \u0026quot;about\u0026quot;) }} \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ .Type }} - {{ .Title }} - {{ .RelPermalink }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ end }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results.

The title on the posts and the about page should both reflect the value in the markdown file.\nAdd “Date Published” to Posts It\u0026rsquo;s common to have posts display the date that they were written or published, so let\u0026rsquo;s add that. The front matter of our posts has a variable named \u0026ldquo;date.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s usually the date the content was created, but let\u0026rsquo;s pretend that\u0026rsquo;s the value we want to display.\nAdd “Date Published” to the Template We\u0026rsquo;ll start by updating the template used to render the posts. The template code will look like:\n{{ .Date.Format \u0026quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026quot; }} Posts use the default single template, so we\u0026rsquo;ll change that file.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results. The posts now have the date displayed in them. There\u0026rsquo;s a problem, though. The \u0026ldquo;about\u0026rdquo; page also has the date displayed.\nAs usual, there are a couple of ways to make the date display only on posts. We could do an \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; statement like we did on the home page. Another way would be to create a separate template for posts.\nThe \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; solution works for sites that have just a couple of content types. It aligns with the principle of \u0026ldquo;code for today,\u0026rdquo; too.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume, though, that we\u0026rsquo;ve made our site so complex that we feel we have to create a new template type. In Hugo-speak, we\u0026rsquo;re going to create a section template.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s restore the default single template before we forget.\n$ mkdir themes/zafta/layouts/post $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Now we\u0026rsquo;ll update the post\u0026rsquo;s version of the single template. If you remember Hugo\u0026rsquo;s rules, the template engine will use this version over the default.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/post/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Note that we removed the date logic from the default template and put it in the post template. Generate the web site and verify the results. Posts have dates and the about page doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Repeat Yourself DRY is a good design goal and Hugo does a great job supporting it. Part of the art of a good template is knowing when to add a new template and when to update an existing one. While you\u0026rsquo;re figuring that out, accept that you\u0026rsquo;ll be doing some refactoring. Hugo makes that easy and fast, so it\u0026rsquo;s okay to delay splitting up a template.\n"});index.add({'id':21,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/posts/migrate-from-jekyll/','title':"Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll",'section':"Blog",'content':"Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like\n▾ \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become\n▾ \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you\u0026rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.\nCreate your Hugo configuration file Hugo can read your configuration as JSON, YAML or TOML. Hugo supports parameters custom configuration too. Refer to the Hugo configuration documentation for details.\nSet your configuration publish folder to _site The default is for Jekyll to publish to _site and for Hugo to publish to public. If, like me, you have _site mapped to a git submodule on the gh-pages branch, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to do one of two alternatives:\n  Change your submodule to point to map gh-pages to public instead of _site (recommended).\n git submodule deinit _site git rm _site git submodule add -b gh-pages git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git public    Or, change the Hugo configuration to use _site instead of public.\n { .. \u0026quot;publishdir\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;_site\u0026quot;, .. }    Convert Jekyll templates to Hugo templates That\u0026rsquo;s the bulk of the work right here. The documentation is your friend. You should refer to Jekyll\u0026rsquo;s template documentation if you need to refresh your memory on how you built your blog and Hugo\u0026rsquo;s template to learn Hugo\u0026rsquo;s way.\nAs a single reference data point, converting my templates for heyitsalex.net took me no more than a few hours.\nConvert Jekyll plugins to Hugo shortcodes Jekyll has plugins; Hugo has shortcodes. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly trivial to do a port.\nImplementation As an example, I was using a custom image_tag plugin to generate figures with caption when running Jekyll.

It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.\nThis document is a brief primer on using Go templates. The Go docs provide more details.\nIntroduction to Go Templates Go templates provide an extremely simple template language. It adheres to the belief that only the most basic of logic belongs in the template or view layer. One consequence of this simplicity is that Go templates parse very quickly.\nA unique characteristic of Go templates is they are content aware. Variables and content will be sanitized depending on the context of where they are used. More details can be found in the Go docs.\nBasic Syntax Golang templates are HTML files with the addition of variables and functions.\nGo variables and functions are accessible within {{ }}\nAccessing a predefined variable \u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo;:\n{{ foo }}  Parameters are separated using spaces\nCalling the add function with input of 1, 2:\n{{ add 1 2 }}  Methods and fields are accessed via dot notation\nAccessing the Page Parameter \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo;\n{{ .Params.bar }}  Parentheses can be used to group items together\n{{ if or (isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;) }} Caption {{ end }}  Variables Each Go template has a struct (object) made available to it. In hugo each template is passed either a page or a node struct depending on which type of page you are rendering. More details are available on the variables page.\nA variable is accessed by referencing the variable name.\n\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt;  Variables can also be defined and referenced.\n{{ $address := \u0026quot;123 Main St.\u0026quot;}} {{ $address }}  Functions Go template ship with a few functions which provide basic functionality. The Go template system also provides a mechanism for applications to extend the available functions with their own. Hugo template functions provide some additional functionality we believe are useful for building websites. Functions are called by using their name followed by the required parameters separated by spaces. Template functions cannot be added without recompiling hugo.\nExample:\n{{ add 1 2 }}  Includes When including another template you will pass to it the data it will be able to access. To pass along the current context please remember to include a trailing dot. The templates location will always be starting at the /layout/ directory within Hugo.\nExample:\n{{ template \u0026quot;chrome/header.html\u0026quot; . }}  Logic Go templates provide the most basic iteration and conditional logic.\nIteration Just like in Go, the Go templates make heavy use of range to iterate over a map, array or slice. The following are different examples of how to use range.\nExample 1: Using Context\n{{ range array }} {{ . }} {{ end }}  Example 2: Declaring value variable name\n{{range $element := array}} {{ $element }} {{ end }}  Example 2: Declaring key and value variable name\n{{range $index, $element := array}} {{ $index }} {{ $element }} {{ end }}  Conditionals If, else, with, or, \u0026amp; and provide the framework for handling conditional logic in Go Templates. Like range, each statement is closed with end.\nGo Templates treat the following values as false:\n false 0 any array, slice, map, or string of length zero  Example 1: If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ index .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }}  Example 2: If -\u0026gt; Else\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{else}} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }}  Example 3: And \u0026amp; Or\n{{ if and (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}}  Example 4: With\nAn alternative way of writing \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent.\nThe first example above could be simplified as:\n{{ with .Params.title }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }}  Example 5: If -\u0026gt; Else If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ else if isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }}  Pipes One of the most powerful components of Go templates is the ability to stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output becomes the input of the following pipe.\nBecause of the very simple syntax of Go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.\nA few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.\nExample 1 :\n{{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }}  is the same as\n{{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }}  It does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good illustration of how to use the pipes.\nExample 2 :\n{{ index .Params \u0026quot;disqus_url\u0026quot; | html }}  Access the page parameter called \u0026ldquo;disqus_url\u0026rdquo; and escape the HTML.\nExample 3 :\n{{ if or (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Stuff Here {{ end }}  Could be rewritten as\n{{ isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot; | if }} Stuff Here {{ end }}  Context (aka. the dot) The most easily overlooked concept to understand about Go templates is that {{ . }} always refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this will be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have the value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. . will no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to access this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable instead of depending on the context.\nExample:\n {{ $title := .Site.Title }} {{ range .Params.tags }} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; - {{ $title }} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }}  Notice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We have defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within the loop.\nHugo Parameters Hugo provides the option of passing values to the template language through the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta data of each specific piece of content. You can define any values of any type (supported by your front matter/config format) and use them however you want to inside of your templates.\nUsing Content (page) Parameters In each piece of content you can provide variables to be used by the templates. This happens in the front matter.\nAn example of this is used in this documentation site. Most of the pages benefit from having the table of contents provided. Sometimes the TOC just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense. We\u0026rsquo;ve defined a variable in our front matter of some pages to turn off the TOC from being displayed.\nHere is the example front matter:\n--- title: \u0026quot;Permalinks\u0026quot; date: \u0026quot;2013-11-18\u0026quot; aliases: - \u0026quot;/doc/permalinks/\u0026quot; groups: [\u0026quot;extras\u0026quot;] groups_weight: 30 notoc: true --- Here is the corresponding code inside of the template:\n {{ if not .Params.notoc }} \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;toc\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;well col-md-4 col-sm-6\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ .TableOfContents }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }}  Using Site (config) Parameters In your top-level configuration file (eg, config.yaml) you can define site parameters, which are values which will be available to you in chrome.\nFor instance, you might declare:\nparams: CopyrightHTML: \u0026#34;Copyright \u0026amp;#xA9; 2013 John Doe. All Rights Reserved.\u0026#34; TwitterUser: \u0026#34;spf13\u0026#34; SidebarRecentLimit: 5 Within a footer layout, you might then declare a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; which is only provided if the CopyrightHTML parameter is provided, and if it is given, you would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped again. This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each January 1st, instead of hunting through your templates.\n{{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}\u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;text-center\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt;{{end}} An alternative way of writing the \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent:\n{{with .Site.Params.TwitterUser}}\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;twitter\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://twitter.com/{{.}}\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;author\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;/images/twitter.png\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;48\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;48\u0026quot; title=\u0026quot;Twitter: {{.}}\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;Twitter\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{{end}} Finally, if you want to pull \u0026ldquo;magic constants\u0026rdquo; out of your layouts, you can do so, such as in this example:\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026quot;recent\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Recent Posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;{{range first .Site.Params.SidebarRecentLimit .Site.Recent}} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{.RelPermalink}}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{.Title}}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{end}}\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; "});index.add({'id':24,'href':'/asian-founders-archive/posts/hugoisforlovers/','title':"Getting Started with Hugo",'section':"Blog",'content':"Step 1.
