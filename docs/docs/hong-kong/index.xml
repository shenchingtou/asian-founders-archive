      <description>Interview with Steven Chan, Founder of GoodNotes: How He Turned an App Idea into a Profitable Business Archive date: May 2, 2019
In his last semester of university, Steven Chan registered for as many bird courses as possible and staked all his efforts into a new app. Since then, he has built his product GoodNotes into an award-winning app featured on Apple’s App Store multiple times. Rather than pursue a venture-backed business model, Steven’s devotion to product development and revenue-driven growth also afforded him the time to pursue other meaningful experiences in life, such as travel and be a digital nomad.</description>

      <description>由荔枝角到觀塘再戰私募基金 Ooosh for startups：客戶成功才是王道！ By : Ten Tang Archive Date: July 4, 2018
客戶成功(Customer Success)不是軟件即服務(SaaS)的專屬名詞！一間在香港的共享工作室，亦憑著「客戶成功才是王道」的經營哲學，不但在短短兩年間擴展到觀塘，更加踩過界大搞私募基金和新創孵化器，致力培養本土的新創公司。這些都是Jeffrey和他的團隊努力的成果。
不怕蝕底，才能與顧客建立長遠的關係 Ooosh for startup 在2016年成立，是一間紮根在荔枝角的共享工作室。短短兩年，Ooosh就吸引了超過50個初創團隊在這10,000尺的空間裡工作。Jeffrey是Ooosh的創辦人，他坦言剛開始的時候，自己在這個行業沒有資源也沒有人脈， 能夠吸引初創公司在Ooosh, 他靠的是四個字 — 不怕蝕底。
「剛開始的時候我們也不太清楚如何能夠幫助初創團隊，所以我常常強調，我們能做到的就是不要計較，我們的職責就是讓他們能夠在這個地方舒舒服服地工作。Be a giver。例如說有人要用會議室但沒有預約，我們會照讓他用，大家溝通好下次用前先預約就好了。」Jeffrey的giver哲學就為他贏了租客的心 — 不但有好幾個團隊打從Ooosh初開張的時候就一直在此工作至今，租客們都非常樂意向朋友介紹Ooosh 。
顧客的成功就是我的成功 Jeffrey在經營Ooosh的時候，大部份的心思都花在如何讓租客可以「有嘢攞走」。而社群管理就是重要的一環。Jeffrey打從一開始就意識到社群的重要性，因為唯有當志同道合的人聚在一起的時候，才能帶起互相學習、互相支持的氛圍。所以Ooosh的團隊在找租客時，很有策略地對準科技新創：一來新創團隊的思想一般比較開明，二來新創團隊的工作很相類似，較容易有共同的話題。
「我最開心的，不是簽了有多大的單，而是租客可以在Ooosh學習到新的知識、有新的啓發可以應用在業務上。」以Ooosh 開業以來最成功的例子，莫過於有位做產品採購的租客，在與其他租客交流時學到了不少軟件開發的知識，因而聘請了程式人員開發了一個簡化作業流程的軟件，拓展業務。
不要只往金錢看，顧客的素質也很重要 Jeffrey很清楚共享工作間的價值，並不在於它所提供的空間，而是這裡的人脈資源。「講真，香港雖然有土地問題，但公司仍有很多選擇：他大可以租一個在工廈的小單位，又或者租一些大型的服務式辦公室。他們為何要選擇你小小的一間共享工作室呢？要吸引他們來，就要能夠提供額外的價值。」因此當Ooosh的團隊招攬租客時，金錢不是唯一的指標；他們希望在Ooosh的租客都是能夠接受新思新的人，這樣才能夠建立一個健康和長遠的社群。
「通常我們對那些很踴躍地問問題、對周遭的環境抱有好奇心的準租客會特別落力推銷；而性格比較惡劣的，沒有辦法，我們通常都不會招呼他們。」Jeffrey對的顧客素質堅持是有回報的。現時Ooosh的會員不但相處融洽、時有交流，每當有新會員加入的時候，他們更會主動地歡迎新成員，甚至比Jeffrey更加熱情！
知多一點 客戶成功一詞的來由：因為軟件即服務的收費模式多為月費訂閱(Monthly Subscription)，所以客戶的忠誠度對他們的收入有很大的影響。而他們發現要提高客戶的忠誠度，只談容戶服務是不足夠的，讓客戶用了你的產品後變得成功才是關鍵！</description>
